I expected no less.Dunno what else to say.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This mouse is amazing, I had owned a Razer Naga, and a R.A.T. 7 mouse. And I am not afraid to say that this mouse takes the cake, for $20 it looks like its worth $80. The only issue i had was that the seller sent me a wireless version, but I don't mind because it works just as well. Also where you see silver on the mouse in reality it is glossy black, and the mouse looks better IRL then in the pictures. I will add on to this review in a month or so to check in.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>we recently had a baby boy so now the use of my home theater system is on the shelf for awhile.  My wife also is not into big sound so decided to try out these wireless headphones.  at first i almost sent them back because i took the easy route and hooked them into my receivers headphone jack.  The sound was terrible and there was the dreaded hissing noise you get with some wireless electronics.  before packing them up i decided to hook them up into the jacks on the TV. Difference was like night and day.  the sound quality is great and really brings out some of the background sounds and music that you typically don't notice unless you are in a movie theater.  They aren't super comfortable for long durations but that can be expected with most headphones.  these come fully recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Works good for a boy of 6 and his parents.This game is not really requiring any skills (be it game skills, memory or else). It is still fun but gets repetitive fast. Said that, my son still enjoyed it enough to want a proper \"adult\" Catan.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Fabric is nice and soft but zipper broke the first time we used it. Very disappointing. The fit was fine, so we still use it to get our monies worth</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>They are screws with square heads, what else do you need to know.  They work, they hold two pieces of wood together.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love this prolduct and the other items that go with it.  Bath and Body dropped this scent so I as thrilled find that I could still purchase it.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This is an ok pump.  It has the nice bracket that can mount to your bike and you have it for the road.And although the image here doesn't show it, it does have the gauge, though it isn't the most accurate gauge (not really a problem when the tire is rated for 55 to 100 PSI).Much like one other reviewer noted, the instructions on how to switch from Schrader to Presta are not very clear and should be researched before fumbling with this blasted thing for hours trying to make it work.And like the title mentions, this isn't as tiny as the MINI name implies.  When looking for a place to mount it on my bike, I am really running short on ideas.  The obvious places would interfere with pedaling.All that said, it puts air in the tire.  Slowly.  It is double action, but the throw isn't very much.  And the higher the pressure, the more difficult it is to pump.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Perfect for the gym or under a few layers for the chilly morning runs. I own quite a few, and just can't get enough!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I'd hoped my 2 year old kitty would have been more enthusiastic about these little Chew Mice, but perhaps she has too many other toys.  All-in-all, they're a good addition to her toy collection.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This had some assembling but overall it is a great product!!! I am a Youtuber and when I make car vlogs it is hard to find a good spot to place my ipod but now I just put this car mount on my windshield and attach my ipod and I am good to go! It also comes with a dashboard mount, but I haven't tinkered with it yet...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Worked like a charm as soon as put it in my camera. I am happy with the card.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Sounds quality is good on these and I bought these to wear at the gym because I can't stand the ear buds and wanted something that wouldn't fall off when I ran. I also love how the cord isn't a regular plastic one, those drive me nuts.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Great fun!  Very versatile...can be packed for any trip to the beach or camping get-away.  Simple fun is the BEST kind!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Hubby loves this brand of hot chocolate and would definitely buy again. It is rich but not too rich. Delicious.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It fits the 15-85 lens perfectly and does not vignette (any more than the camera, a 40D, already does). When I put my camera in it's carrying bag I turn the hood around backwards and it fits perfectly. You can buy a third party hood for less, but this one is high quality and I don't see the reason to skimp on it, especially after paying $700 for the lens.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>In theory this product should work great. But the automatic stop on the filing head is to senitive.  The slighest pressure against the head and it stopped.  A waste of money.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The bottom of the Manfrotto 494RC2 Ball Head (40mm) is smaller than the top of my monopod's mounting plate (Oben ACM-2400, 60mm), so the monopod's three lock screws do not engage with the bottom of the head.  As a result, the ball head is held in place only by the friction of the main screw attachment.  I was able to tightened down the ball head to my satisfaction, although removing the ball head may now be problematic, as it just swivels without getting looser.Otherwise this ball head is excellent.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Love kingston memory, I have never had any issues with there memory for years.. I like this because it has a heat sink on the memory to keep it cooler and it also helps when installing the memory in your computer. Great price and just feels good in your hand when your installing it.. not so fragile</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>These are an innovative way to Clean between teeth - plain and simple !They are not as strong as could be, but they work well and are easy to use.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I didn't think this would be as nice as it was. Fits the X-long twin mattress great. A lot for the money.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>If you're trying to decide between FreshSaver and Ziploc vacuum systems, here's good news.  You can make this pump work with Ziploc bags too!Here's how:  Get one of the FreshSaver Handheld pumps, and order the very inexpensive ZipLoc hand pump as well.  Pull the blue rubber sealing ring from the bottom of the ZipLoc hand pump.  You'll find it fits perfectly onto the business end of the FreshSaver pump.  With the blue ring in place the FreshSaver pump works on both Ziploc and FresSaver bags.  You can use whichever brand is on sale this week.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>this came in handy for moving my expensive mattress and box spring. They sell the same at the hardware stores for about the same price so unless you are in a hurry i would recommend the hardware store.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My bike doesn't have holes on the frame to install a water bottle holder, so i bought this to put first. It can be installed horizontally or vertically. It does it's job well.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Did not fit my vehicle. No use to me at all, Probably my fault.This is not an easy to use page</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Got the 610n to replace my JetDirect 3 port external print server.  The 610 is a great product - which is truly a simple \"plug-n-play\" upgrade.  And... the Vista \"Add A Printer\" wizard, quickly found the printer on the network, and installed it, with no hitches.  Couldn's be easier... and... the price is right!  Great way to upgrade an older printer!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought this rack to accomodate 2 kids bikes and 2 adult bikes.  I researched bike racks extensively and was relieved when the rack arrived and appeared to be very high quality.  The hardware fittings are oversized, the frame is heavy duty, the padding where the bike frames rest are thick, molded rubber and the velcro straps are about 2inches wide with plenty of length to ensure confidence. There is not a single piece of plastic or cheap material on this bike rack.  It took about 30 minutes to assemble the rack and get it ready for hitch installation.  One glitch I found was that the threads on my rack were reversed.  While the instructions said to screw the bolt from the passenger side through the hitch, mine was clearly too loose after installation.  The rack needs to screw in TIGHT into the hitch.  Luckily I tried to screw it from the drivers side and it worked just fine.  There is minimal clearance between the two pieces once the rack is fully installed.  There is a heavy duty pin that allows for tilting the rack to access the trunk.Now the fun part begins.  Make no mistake, the first time you try to mount your bikes, plan for 45 minutes!  This is a game of Tetris, but once you figure out the right configuration for your bikes, the mounting should take no more than 10 minutes including straps. We ended up putting the 2 kids bikes first then the 2 adult bikes. (yes the kids bikes Require an extension bar.) Keep in mind, there will always be points where the bikes rub together, but you can minimize touch points by moving the pedals to the optimal position.  After that, we used knee and elbow pads as padding between the bikes.  This works like a charm!  The velcro straps allow for a variety of secure positions and we haven't scratched our bikes at all!The last part of securing the bikes includes straps.  It is recommened to strap any bike that uses an extension bar from the bike frame or tire to the bike rack directly.  This provides extra security should the extension bar fail, the bikes will still be strapped to the bike rack.  I usually wrap one long strap around the first pair of bikes securing them to the rack, and attach another strap to the second pair of bikes and rack.  The last strap I use is secured from the bike rack to the roof rack of my SUV.  This is actually a critical part of feeling secure!  This is an anti-sway strap that keeps the entire bike rack from moving too much when you hit a bump in the road or go over a train track.  Trust me, you want to buy this strap!Our first road trip with the bikes fully loaded took us across 4 hours of highway and country roads.  The bikes arrived without a scratch and my nerves were intact too.  We have used the rack now 10+ times and each time it gets easier.  Overall, I highly recommend this bike rack.  It is a very strong and sturdy extension of your vehicle.  The only drawback I see is that it doesn't fold down.  But the single post allows me to mount kids bikes, the tilt function is perfect and easy to use, the strength in design is obvious so I will accept the single drawback happily!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>This vacuum is one of the worst vacuums I have ever purchased. The premise behind it is great, but the longevity and performance of this vacuum need vast improvement before the product is brought into the market.In addition to poor suction, you have a motor that loses a charge faster than anything I've ever owned (which includes the very first rechargable batteries and you remember how horrible those were)</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We had a chair like this when I was a kid, only it was yellow. This one is just as good a product, with the added bonus that it's red (my favorite color).</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is truly an exceptional wristwatch/computer that will no doubt live up to the Suunto namsake. GET THIS WATCH! Enough said......</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Great keyboard.  I ordered this at the advice of a co-worker.  It works great with my Ipad and I love the larger keyboard!!!</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>So far batteries are good and easy to install.  Great price!  However, I ordered in mid-Oct and got them on Jan 5 after having contacted Amazon twice.  I probably would not order from the vendor again.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Simple, portable cassette player with software a USB connection.  Great value.  It would be nice if it was bundled with a 120V adapter.  Batteries not included.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>For the price, a well-made little footstool.  Just screw in the legs and you're done.  The protective plastic covering the padded top is difficult to remove. I'm not sure what the small area inside the hinged top will hold -- but is still a nice touch.  I'm happy with this purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Love it, much lighter and thinner than the others I have used. Thank you so much for this excellent product!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have worn Wigwam socks for many years now they are a very quality sock. These are the best cotton tube socks i have found.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>We bought three of these at the same time for rooms in our house, and two of the 3 units leaked water from underneath and soaked the carpets and floors underneath.  The other one seemed to work fine.  We even put the tops on nice and secure, we thought perfectly.  I do not recommend this product at all.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>i don't live on my hard drive so this is one of the best decisions i ever made. i will get another one soon.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I've had this phone for almost a year now, and it has certainly served it's purpose. I haven't had any issues sending or receiving messages and phone calls, and it's done everything I need it to do... just not as smoothly as I think it should. I decided to write a review from the perspective of someone who has had the phone long enough to know the bugs.The touch screen worked well for the first month or two, and I finally began to get used to texting on it. Unfortunately over time the phone has become less and less responsive. (And I am not hard on electronics) It still works with a little extra pressure, but this can become frustrating. The touch sensitivity is not 100% accurate either. You'd think after a year I would be used to texting on the number keypad, but the phone frequently thinks I'm typing a key across the screen. Unfortunately, it often thinks I'm hitting the clear button when my finger is a few buttons away. Also, the phone has difficulty sensing touch in some of the menus. I can push a button 10 different ways and it still won't open sometimes.I love Tracfone, and this phone has served its purpose, but I would not recommend it. I finally am getting so fed up with trying to push buttons and navigate menus that I'm getting a different Tracfone without a touch screen.What I do love about this phone is the speaker quality for both calls and the music player. I've also had very few issues with it unlocking in my pocket and making calls. The battery life is phenomenal and will last me five days to a week with moderate usage.If you're going Tracfone (which I recommend because it is so much cheaper than everyone else!) I would suggest avoiding touch screens because they are not quite up to the standard responsiveness that we are used to. If you want a lesson in patience though, this is the way to go. ;)</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Could this possibley be the future, is cloning that far away.  Weird thing is that the possibility of this happening in the future becomes more and more an more of a reality.  I am not a big sci-fi fan but i actually sat through the whole two hours and fifiteen mintutes. The action seen and special effects are incrediable.  Good  Work Michael Bay......</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Watched YouTube video because there were no instructions in the packaging. Save your money and buy these. Word to the wise, part your hair in small parts and sit under a dryer for best results. Done on 4b/4c natural and relaxed hair. Great results.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>WHAT IS GOING ON???.

The Tapes have the Issue of not overlapping exactly perfectly at times, exposing the Adhesive of the Labels which can collect Debris. The Printing, occasionally, has \"drop outs\" where parts of the information are missing. Again, typical of this line of Labelers and Tapes. The Tapes can get dirty if you are not careful, so keep them in the Case when not loaded into the Labeler. I read in another Review about lack of room in the Case for Tapes. I found enough room for one of each size Tape. That's all I need. Of course, the Labeler has one Tape loaded, too. The Power Adaptor is nice as a Back Up and I've used it that way a few times, but mostly I just run on Batteries. Large Labels with Large Bold Lettering also benefit from using the Power Adaptor. I'm considering cutting the Top of the Case Off to make it easier to maneuver and use, and then using Velcro to hold it back on for Storage. A Removable Lid would have been a nice touch.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>There are lighter alternatives for water purification, but iodine is not recommended for people like me with thyroid disease, and this filter is still relatively lightweight, easy to use, and easy to share.  Water moves both while pumping up and down, and the action is smooth and easy.  I have used this at 3 different backcountry water sources so far without getting sick.The main drawback is that it's a little clumsy to both work the pump and balance the container, and I've accidentally dropped a water bottle into a creek.  It includes connectors for connecting directly to a hydration bladder, but it expects 1/4\" inner diameter tubing, and all the bladders I have found use larger diameter.  I finally found this bladder which has tubing too large, but has compatible connectors that I can make work with some extra tubing from the hardware store.  I'll be trying it out on my next trip in a couple weeks, and hopefully that will help with the clumsiness issue.  If anyone knows a better bladder to use, please leave a comment.Just a quick warning about the moral hazard of using gear like this.  When you can filter as much water as you want, it's easy to think you're safe and abandon a little caution.  I had to backtrack a half mile on my last trip because a water source I was aiming for turned out to be dried up for the season, but I passed up a perfectly good source because I still had a little water left.  A half mile isn't a big deal, but it could have been a lot worse if the distance had been longer.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We got this so we could whip eggs into stiff peaks without getting the mixer out for 2 or 3 eggs. It works really well and cleans up easily.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Wen my husband told me that he needed a new lumbar belt and couldn't find one anywhere I knew exactly where to go....I went directly to Amazon.com.  There we found the perfect one.  One size  fits all.  It's sturdy and comfortable and has a velcro opening.  And it was practically half price compared to the one he had before.  What else can anyone want???</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The Norelco replacement heads I received fit nicely and serve very well. No more \"pulling\". The old blades served well for three years,which I thought was a long time.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Product was just as described and met our expectations.  We will definitely order more later to meet our store needs.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Would have been nice to know this thing came in a chinese box, nothing but gibberish writen all over it, booooo!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Nice quality for the price. Legs have a hard time staying in sometimes, but overall are nice looking and not too large.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We love these markers. They state right on the package that washable refers to your child's hands and body. These are not intened for use on walls or fabric. That said, these markers are terrific, They are long lasting and the perfect size for little hands. My 4 year old reaches for these far more often then she does her crayons and colored pencils. Best of all she can doodle to her heart's content on her arms or hands and it washes right off with just water. A+ in my book.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I loved the soft hot pink of this outfit in the picture but when I got it in the mail it was an awful harsh orange/pink color that hurts your eyes to look at. Very sad because it's  really cute. Too bad :-/</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It might be my imagination but this stuff seems to help my neck and upper shoulder area from being tensed up all day. I love the smell.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Primary reason I bought these is because I was looking for comfort and quality in an affordable price range, $100-$150.  Bought these for a little over $100 and have hardly taken them off since.  Comfort is a 10/10.  I can wear these literally all day and not have a headache or earache.  The only time I'm bothered is with wearing glasses, and only that after 12+ hours of wearing these nonstop.  Even then it's not bad.  I often find myself wearing these without even listening to anything, they're that comfortable.As for quality, I mostly use these for playing games and listening to music.  They sound really good with a higher volume with a good balance.  They do have an open sound, which means sound leaks out rather significantly at high volumes but you don't have an &#34;inside your own head&#34; feeling like with closed headphones, so overall a positive.  I wouldn't use these out and about but I don't think I'd wear anything but earbuds outside anyway.  Quality is very good for music, hard to judge for studio use since I just don't have as much experience with higher-end headphones since I can't afford them.  However, from the studio headphones I have used, these are at least on par and will get the job done very well.  The open &#34;leaking&#34; would be my main concern for recording using a mic, but it is easily solved by keeping the volume reasonable.Overall, very happy with my purchase and the next pair of headphones I get would be another just like these unless I have the money for something top-of-the-line.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I used this product to help me fight bad breath and control tartar and even fight gingivitiswell to my disappointment this has actually made my mouth worse and created a new problem, white film is peeling from my cheeksalso the tastes is awful</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>After many tries this item would only work about 1 in 5 tries. Time wasted. Really looked forward to getting this item. Totally disappointed.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My baby on the way. Fits perfectly snug fit on crib. Test it by placing one knee in the center then the sides and it felt firm. Other mattress i could feel the floor. Will update once baby arrives</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It's exactly as shown..it took about a month but overall good quality good look.Love that it can fit different size wrists</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>What a fun cake pan! Be sure to use the baking pan with flour in the spray or the good ole fashion method some butter and flour. If you don't it will stick. Also be sure to flip the pan over before it cools. The pan leaves good indention's - easy to frost. Not just for kids men love to have a car cake also.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love this little product! Sound quality is great (that was my fear) and the battery last a long time. I sadly lost it after more than a week of using daily and run to amazon and order a new one that same day. One of the best BT headsets I have use in a while</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This was a great find and buy. Great sound for the price. A must  to have if on a budget.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This soap smells great. I also got the air spray and counter cleaner. It works very good and it smells sooo good. The honeysuckle smells great also. No more smelly 408 for me.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I read the reviews with the problems and the solutions. I've been messing with personal computers for over 30 years so I figured \"I can handle that.\"It worked well on two computers but for some strange reason one of the Windows 7 computers would just not see the server. I used the IP address method and tried several ways to access it but they just wouldn't work. Very strange...  So, its on the way back to Amazon. They are great!Solution to the \"problem\", replace the inexpensive USB printer with a new network attached printer from Amazon, of course.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I love most Hex bug products, but we bought a few of these and all have stopped working after a few 'battles'. Very disappointing.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Gave as gift, Easy assembly, She immediately was able to operate on her own, love' s it, indoor or outdoor use</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I ordered this recipe binder because it came with supplies for the inside.

NOT TRUE. They're actually rounder than the look and work wonderfully. Definitely a must have when you're staining/painting. I'll probably get more some day.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Wow!!! A tour-de-force by America's preeminent choir! Those people that can \"feel choral music in their soul\", rather than just listen to music, cannot help but to be impressed with this CD. Of especial power are \"Joy to the World\", \"Silent Night\", and the \"Hallelujah Chorus\". Hearing these songs sung by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir has to be as close to listening to Heaven's Choir of Angels that you will get here on earth.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>In the lake I like to float around on a large round floatation device to sun bathe and this is so great for use with it to keep me from blowing away, it keeps me anchored in a general area away from the rocks.

Great for my household jobs very helpfull thank you</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>The price is right but this is a true case of you get what you pay for.  It lasts, from full charge to empty, about 1 and a half hours before it needs to be charged again with normal non video use.  The original battery it is supposed to replace had approximately twice the battery life.  I should have returned it immediately but my laptop developed legs (got it back) and is outside the window to return.  I would not recommend purchasing this product, keep looking.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This is a great accessory to the Scoop Free Self-Cleaning litter box.  It has pegs that fit right into holes on the litter box, and it is very secure.  The plastic is sturdy, and my cats haven't knocked it off at all.It really helps in keeping the litter in the box.  Sure, your kitty is going to bring a little out with him, but not nearly as much as he could scatter when he's digging around.My only problem is that the hood seems a little low for larger cats.  I have a great big, 20 lb male who is very tall.  He has to stoop down very low to get comfortable in there to do his business, and sometimes he ends up \"depositing\" behind the rake.  Not a big deal, cause he's a pretty easy going cat, but I think they could make this hood taller.Other than that, love it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My puppy didn't like it very much at first.  He had to get used to it. But now he loves it.  It makes feeding a raw diet so easy, healthy and balanced!!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I have a hard time finding earbuds thzt stay in my ears but don't hurt. I find these earbuds extremely comfortable and they sound incredible. And the varied tip sizes guarantee almost everyone will be able to use them.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Love this acrylic lipStick holder. I read reviews for other ones stating that they were too small for certain lipsticks but these holes are large enough for all different brands from drugstore to high end. It's a perfect fit for my drawer where I keep my makeup. I only wish u had a vanity to display it on.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have this magnifier for over 6 months now. This is a practical handy magnifier. It serves my purpose of magnifying some small letters. I have not yet used its LED lighting power because such need did not arise yet. The plastic marking that said &#34;remove before first use&#34; is still intact. So far, I'm already satisfied with its uses. I like the idea that I can fold it easily for easy storage. I highly recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Livescribe pens is a tool for the future of teaching.  These grid notebooks are fantastic for high school math teachers.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This was my first Bose purchase and I am glad I spent the extra money for these!  Although they are not noise canceling, when I wear them they block most of my two young boys out!  Enough to easily fall asleep.  I listen to country music and talk radio programs;  they both never sounded better.  For those who like really loud music, I am sorry to say that this pair of Bose may not be for you.Shipping was great, arrived a day early and well packaged.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>i never got the little stylus  i have no other response i have no other response i have no other response</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>What with the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic coming up in a few days, I figured why not go see the 3D re-release of 1997's Titanic.I've long been a fan of both disaster movies and melodramas set in the Gilded Age, so a combination of the two seemed a natural fit for me. Now, I had enjoyed this the first time I viewed it (holy cow, can it really be 15 years ago? I'm feeling old...), but I'm well aware that it's long been fashionable in some circles to make fun of the film. But you know, I don't think it really deserves it.Oh, there's no doubt the star of the film is the ship; the screenplay itself is less than stellar. It's a bit hokey and clunky and heavy-handed, with no real subtlety or originality. But in one sense, these attributes actually work well with a story set in this era; the simple plot (with a broad portrayal of both good and evil characters) is presented in a fashion similar to how a melodrama would have been depicted back in 1912, whether on-stage or in the earliest short silent films. I found myself thinking that the script really wasn't nearly as bad as many people have made it out to be, over the intervening years since the film was first released.That said, I'm afraid that the film didn't really \"grab\" me as much this time around, as it had when I first saw it when I was a good deal younger. Maybe I'm just getting old and tired and cynical? Or, perhaps it's the fact that I'm not a big fan of any of the actors in the film, and have no interest whatsoever in the two playing the leads. I think if the film featured some acting talent about whom I was enthusiastic, who I was excited to see on the screen, I would have found the film to be considerably more riveting. As it is---eh, I'm not all that thrilled with any of the characters apart from Molly Brown, who I thought was a lot of fun in every one of her too-brief scenes.Hmmm, what can I say---I still enjoy the picture (though it's not one that I'm likely to re-watch often in its entirety) and I do recommend it. However---any film with a running time of over three hours needs to have an intermission! Sitting still that long is too hard on the butt---heh.The 3D conversion was nicely done, but not exceptional. I thought it would be a little more striking, in fact---after the first hour I kind of forgot that I was even seeing it in 3D. But, no real complaints on this score.This re-release may not set any box-office records, but after only a week in theatres it's already easily paid for the 3D conversion process and is making a tidy profit.---SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING---Oh, I do have one huge complaint---and there's probably no need to even post spoiler warnings, because doesn't everyone already know exactly what happens at the end? While I find the very end of the film most touching---haunting, even---the bit that comes before that annoys the heck out of me. I STILL am ticked off that \"old Rose\" threw the priceless blue diamond into the water! I don't care how symbolic it is---explain it any way you like, that was just a stupid and pointless and senseless thing to do to an art object that had huge historical significance. Holy cow, she could have just written out a complete account of her story and packed it up along with the gem---and then upon her death made sure her will specified that the package was delivered to the Smithsonian, or something like that. Man---even writing out these words, and I find I'm getting ticked off all over again! So, that's the one thing that I really hate about this film.Well, now that I'm thinking about the ship, I'm curious to view both the 1950's version ofTitanic(starring Barbara Stanwyck) andA Night to Remember (Criterion Collection)(also from the 1950's). I've seen both films, but it's been a while and I don't have a clear recollection of either...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Now everybody gets an even sized wedge.Fast and easy eight section wedger.Might even work with tangerines too.Would definitely recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Nicer than I expected.

The screen cover does make it a little harder to view my pictures in the direct sun.  A second problem is that dust gets between the LCD screen and the inside of the cover.  The dust requires that I remove the cover to clean it.  The answer would be for the manufacture to add a gasket to the inside of their screen protector to seal it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The Sony just came the other day but it was sent to us quickly, perfectly packaged, and put it together very easily.  So far so good.  Great product.  Will come back to review again if anything changes.

When I got it today I looked at it and it does not have a wooden handle.The metal was good and well set in the handle but it was not wood and neither is the sheath. The steel is good but I was looking forward to wood. All in all I am glad I bought it but I do not appreciate false advertising.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I had never had a selzter bottle before.  Like some others, I had started buying plain carbonated water but was appalled at how quickly the empty bottles piled up.  This one fit the bill perfectly.I now charge about 1 liter a day, adding some flavorings and enjoying it quite a bit.  I start with keeping the siphon in the refrigerator, along with (Brita) filtered chilled water.  I find it's best to let it infuse at least an hour after charging but it is still effective if you want to use it immediately.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My dogs love these treats.

Installed about a month ago and it works as advertised.  Installation is quite simple, just be careful to route the wires to avoid pinching them.  The device that is supposed to hold the lock to keep it from falling out of the door while you install it is weak.  I would suggest a little blue masking tape to hold it securely because you wouldn't want to bounce test your expensive new lock.  This is installed on the garage door.  Now I don't have to remember to bring the key to get into the garage.  I would leave it unlocked, the wife would lock it, etc.  That problem is entirely solved with this very stylish lockset.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>It looks the same as it does on the preview, but it is really low resolution. It's like they have taken an image and resized it 10 times. Not a &#34;original&#34; poster, this is simply a print out/copy of an image. Although it does look okey from a distance, I expected it to be of a quality similar to other movie posters.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It's cheaper online than at Fry's.

Plus Crosman and Gamo would not sell anything that would harm your airsoft, bb or pellet guns.  If they did, and it was one of their guns, still in warranty, they would have to repair it.One thing I have learned is never put the bb's that come with your air gun in your air gun, unless it is a cheap spring powered gun.  A lot of high end guns come with a cleaning rod to unplug the cheep bb's, because they are not well rounded.  Over the years I have owned quite a few and now my grandchildren own some of them.  I trust the Crosman and Gamo names.  They make the best for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Meet my expectations and more.  Great color and feel. Easy to handle. Very durable.

Only thing to remember is to give it a tap & wait until you see the zeros before getting on. I have used it almost every day for a couple of years now & it still works like new. I even take it in my suitcase on trips. Although I must warn you that if you put it in your carry-on luggage, they will search your suitcase right at security. I've replaced the battery once and it was not expensive.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>A well made functional coffee maker with hot water which works great and is quick. I like the cone shaped coffee filter makes great coffee. We drink tea in our house and this is easy to use for making tea, cup o noodles etc...We use filtered water so the water reservoir for the tea is never smelly like I had read in some other posts.

Firstly, this is not at all for a small newborn (8 lbs) this is clearly for a larger child maybe 3 months and older.  Secondly anything that you need the help of another person to use really isn't worth it's weight in gold!  This felt like putting on a strait jacket and then trying to figure out how to get the child in there without him suffoccating on his mothers breasts was like pulling teeth.  This may be a carrier for larger babies (we'll see in the future) but for now and a newborn, it is not worth the money nor the sweat poured after trying to get this contraption on.  Oh and yes I did try this on myself because I couldn't understand my daughter's compllints until I walked (or didn't walk) in her shoes with this thing on me and my grandson nearly suffocating to death.  We'll wait until he's about 6 months and use it for back carrying.  I purchased a carrier for myself several years ago for my son and it was awesome, wish I could remember the brand and style...this surely wasn't it.  Disappointed. 2 stars ONLY because were waiting a few months before trying ti again.  We'll be back!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Our son is obsessed with Jack the pirate.

I was about to take him to the Vet and then I stumbled upon this shampoo. I decided to try it and if it didn't work, then off to the vet we will go.. I brought my dog up to the bathroom where he immediately jumped in the tub ready for his bath. I lathered him thoroughly and just kept massaging it into his skin for 10 minutes. He just sat there, enjoying the rub down. After drying him off and letting him relax, I noticed an immediate difference in his skin. A couple days later and his scabs are almost gone and less flakes in his coat. I definitely recommend this product for a dog who has skin problems. At no more than $13, what do you have to lose? Possible a trip to the Vet.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The more I use this, the more I LOVE IT!I have several other apple corers and slicers. They are going into the trash now!What sold me was watching the video. Still, I was suspicious.I've been fooled before by such things. NOT THIS TIME!I use this almost every day now for both apples and pears. It works PERFECTLY with very little effort.It washes well in the dishwasher too.The base (used to \"Pop\" the core and wedges)is hinged,so it can not be separated nor lost;PLUS I have found it allows me to use this slicer as a \"SERVER\"!After I \"Slice, Core and Pop\" an apple or pear,I remove the core (or sometimes NOT) and set it on the tablefor my wife and I to select the perfectly cut wedges. It is a cool SERVER!We think it looks very attractive in the way the apple or pear appears ... inviting you to take a piece.I am going to buy another one (maybe more for my daughters),because sometimes it is in the dishwasher and I want to use it again(I COULD, hand wash it, I suppose ... I'd rather buy another one).Just think, wouldn't some cold, crisp and tasty sliced apple or pear taste really great right now?You will be very happy with this \"Wedge and Pop\", believe me!UPDATE:I bought three more. I bought a spare for us, and one each for my two daughters.Caution: When unpacking take extra care. Two twist ties secure the wedge and pop to the packaging,These must be untied with your fingers quite near the very sharp blades. Don't rush and be watchful!When you are selecting the apples and pears to buy, choose ones that are as \"evenly symetrical\" as possible.If you don't (experience talking), it will be difficult to push the wedge and pop through the fruit,PLUS it will not core the fruit properly and the result will be less than ideal.STILL, all in all ... I would give the wedge and pop MORE than 5 stars, if I could!GREAT product!{Did my review help you decide?}</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>THIS WAS MY FAV OUT OF ALL TE CASES I ORDERED. IT TOOK FOREVER TO COME BUT IT WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT. FITS PERFECT AND LOOKS VERY CUTE! LOVE IT!!!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Firm hold, but not too stiff. Great for holding curls that would normally fail due to weather. GREAT GREAT product!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>For all those giving this movie 1-2 star ratings, please understand the serious problems involved in making this thing.  The film was originally scheduled for a 2002 release but it suffered from production and serious financial problems -- the company went bankrupt during post-production. I'm guessing they HAD to slap together something and get it released to make enough money just to pay off all the lawyers.The \"cheesy\" CGI was of the quality found in big-budget TV sci-fi shows of that time (like Star Trek Voyager). The post-production team probably could not afford to buy high-end \"Jurassic Park\" type CGI for a B-movie. The CGI renditions they used are passable on a TV-size screen but come off as absolutely horrid on a 40 foot screen. I suspect this is why much of the film was shot in low-light environments -- don't have to show as much detail.As noted by many, the film also suffered from terrible scripting; don't blame the actors, they have to work with what's placed in front of them.Remember, the movie was based on a Ray Bradbury sci-fi short story written in the 1950's -- long before much was known about how dinosaurs became extinct, or the fact that the Earth suffered numerous mass-extinctions throughout its history. The whole \"butterfly effect\" is absurdly ridiculous especially given the fact the plot has a pyroclastic flow from an erupting volcano wiping out all the local life anyway. Nor can we ignore the giant comet / meteor that wiped out some 90% of all life on the planet 65-million years ago (that probably was not known as a scientific fact when Bradbury wrote the story).Did it ever occur to anyone that maybe the butterfly was SUPPOSED to die and that the \"time-wave\" events depicted in the movie ,in fact, showed the correct version of evolution? Maybe it was Homo Sapiens (and all other primates) who shouldn't be here today? Maybe it was the highly-evolved simian-reptiles who actually made the first journey back to the Jurassic tar-pit and THEY were the ones who screwed everything up in the first place?Never the less, I gave the movie a charitable 3-star rating. Suitable for kids cooped up in the house on a rainy Saturday afternoon or a dorm room beer party. Cheap entertainment, just avoid thinking while viewing and you'll be o.k. Good B-movie sci-fi fun.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This switch is built like a tank and running just fine, unlike the part it replaces.  It's nice having something reliable, when other components of my Internet access are suspect.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>It is pyrex glass, but not original Pyrex quality.Differences vs. original Pyrex containers:1: glass not as thick although adequate.2: no lips or other shapes on the top edges for grasping.  The top edges are simply straight up making it difficult to grasp expecially when full of hot food.3: covers of each container are not pyrex, but thin plastic.  The original pyrex containers always also came with Pyrex lids.So there is a trade-off in the low cost.  Next time I would probably just buy the more expensive original designs...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I received these right away and thought they were delicious, if you have an upset stomach these will help you and they taste great to, my co-workers liked them also.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I got this for my wife's new car and she loves it.

They were still about a 1/2 in too long on each finger. I found these on here and decided to try them. They fit great with a little extra room in the tips. My son loves the way they feel and even said they make his hands look cool lol. He could also easily put these on and strap them himself without any help. For a 5 year old, my son is kind of average build but tall and skinny so these are a great fit. These gloves do stretch some to accomodate larger fingers, but I don't know how comfortable that would be for the kid.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Now I think I have all the chargers I or my wife need, until another one gets lost.

Unlike the other customers, I bought this telescope at a local store with a 2-year warranty. Thus, the telescope was unbroken and packaged properly. The instruction manual was detailed and the telescope came with a software known as theSky, which is a useful program that allows you to locate celestial bodies at the place and time which you are at.The telescope itself is a sturdy unit, and was properly collimated. With its 127mm aperture, I could easily view planets, stars, and also the moon with great ease. The telescope mount is german equatorial, which was useful as it allows you to track down the star you want to find in the night sky by countering the earth's rotation. As this type of mounting also causes the telescope to move in a slow motion, it is easier to pinpoint a star as compared to an alt-azimuth mount.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The hardware works very well, and the fact that it's solid-state is a huge bonus since my drive get's a lot of travel time. The battery life is great! Oh, did I mention that it has a battery?!? The problem lies in the software. If Toshiba put half as much time into developing the software as they did the hardware, this would be an amazing portable drive. The Android app simply does not work for me (Samsung Note 3). It crashes each time I try to use it, so I could not even test it to see what kinds of features it has. The PC interface is not great, but it works. I really hope Toshiba spends some time fixing the software-side of this product, because if/when they do it will be absolutely worth having.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I received this product complementary from Influenster and absolutely love these pens!

I ordered this when my wrist pain was at its worst, due to my continual typing day in and day out.  When the item came, it looked a little smaller than I expected, but it fit my wrist comfortably.  This being small actually turned out to be an advantage; I could easily remove it when I'm not typing and stash it into my pocket until I need it again.After about few weeks of use, my wrist pain subsided substantially.  And I've been using this for almost a year now, and the pain is completely gone!The only issue with this is that, after many days of use, it starts picking up bad oder.  So you need to wash it well every now and then.  I just throw it into my washing machine every now and then when it starts smelling bad.  That seems to do the trick.All in all, I'm very happy with this product.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I ordered the one shown here with Aloe and Vitamin E.

I first tried Nizoral 1% shampoo but it did nothing for me.  Then I tried Neutrogena T-Gel and it didn't do enough.  T-Sal is the strongest medicinal shampoo you can buy for scalp dermatitis that I know of.  You must use a lot of the shampoo and lather it up and leave it on your scalp for at least 5 minutes for maximum benefit.  Also do not forget to also use the shampoo around your ears, your neck and your forehead as the skin there may also be affected by the dermatitis.  I bought the 5 bottle package and I have already used the first bottle in little over a month.  I plan to continue to use this shampoo as I have noticed an improvement in my scalp problems.  This shampoo is only for those who suffer from seborrhea and psoriasis of the scalp and other dermatitis.  You do not need it for regular dandruff.  If you have normal dandruff, get Head and Shoulders.  T-Sal is for more than just dandruff.  I use a Pantene anti-breakage conditioner after I use this shampoo.  It seems to help my hair look more normal after medicating with the T-Sal shampoo.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These bags are perfect for my purposes and were cheaper than bags I purchased from another site before I thought to look on Amazon.

It is well made with metal hinges, unlike a lot of it's competitors. Folded out flat, it will cut out the perfect sized circle for your pie.  It does a great job of crimping and sealing the edges. If you make a lot of empanadas, dumplings or handpies, this tool is for you.

They are a godsend. My favorite part is that you can disengage them after the baby goes to bed. Or even better, you don't have to uninstall them when your child grows older. You can just put them in the \"off\" position. Then if you have company over with small children, one flip of the red switch on each lock and you are child proofed again! Highly recommended!Kristine</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Great little white balance cards, but much overpriced. Lanyard is too large and unnecessary.

The lines of the handle and blade are mated perfectly. The overall look and feel of this knife equal a magnificent execution of an implressive design.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is the best coffee maker I've ever had.  It's fast, quiet, and the coffee is hot (no more preheating the cup).  It has a 30 min shutoff. The stainless pot means no fear of breakage.There is NO PROBLEM of dribbling spout as mentioned in previous reviews. Maybe Cuisinart redesigned it after the feedback. The spout sticks out 5/8\" and pours perfectly.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I used TRX in the gym and I was looking to buy one for my home use and for travels. I read the reviews and honestly chose this one for its price. I was very surprised by the quality of this piece when I received it. I have been using Jungle Gym for almost a month and  I could not find any drawback. The design of the arm grips and foot cradles makes it much more comfortable for extensive use.I'd recommend Jungle Gym for anyone who's been looking for a suspension trainer.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This item has a great construction.

We also have Yealink SIP-T28PYealink SIP-T28P na 1-Handset 6-Line Landline Telephone. Yes, both phones works great with clear setup(Web-based setup like your router setting). Very clear display, clear feature set and clear feature set along with smooth setting. As long as you have the correct setup info(VoIP server, account and password), setup would be easy! Hope to have more chance to try other Yealink Product! Our company uses T28s mostly, we purchase this one to connect to the paging system and it worked great!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>we bought for a Hallloween costume for my son, and then threw it in our costume pile.  It gets played with at least once a week, and unlike other wings, it can take a beating and not fall apart.  Not like the wire and mesh ones!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This Kit is well designed and built. It was designed to fit many vehicles. But unfortunately it does not fit my 2000 Saturn SL. There is a motor mount very close to the oil filter where the adapter screws on in place of the oil filter and there is not enough room.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I wanted something that adds some volume to my lips.

The water heats up so much faster than my old stove top kettle. My only concern, and the reason for only giving it 4 stars, is that I have noticed some rusty calcium build up showing up where the handle meets the body of the kettle. Initially I was using tap water, but switched to using Sparkletts after about a week. So i don't know if this was caused by the tap water and I just didn't notice or if it is in fact a defect. Unfortunatetly I noticed the problem a little too late to return it, but so far it hasn't affected its perfomance. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase given the reasonable price.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>At first I thought this product was not that good, but then I found the markers do work well once I do the following:1. Turn the markers upside down, and store in a cup so they stay upside down.2. Lightly dampen the tip of a marker before using it the first time.3. Press the tip down on a surface firmly for several seconds, release, press again. Then the ink will start to flow.4. Colors are vibrant enough to suit me when I turn on the light board.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have not had a good camera since my early 20's when I managed to lose my Canon AE-1 with several lenses, flash etc. in Jamaica. Life and kids has regulated me to digital cameras of the point and shoot variety until now. I did tons of research online, consulted with several Photography types, and came up with the FujiFilm X series. I settled on the X-E1 over the X-M1 for the viewfinder and not the X-Pro1 due to size and cost.This camera is the most pleasant to operate of any camera I have seen since cameras went digital. You want to set Aperture? Roll the ring on the lens, just like you did with a film camera. Shutter speed? Dial on top again like a film camera. There are no 'Mode' dials anywhere to be found, on 'Sports, Mountain, Birthday cake settings' . just plain simple controls. If you want the shutter speed to be automatic, set it to A, same with Aperture.If you want more, there are tons of options in the menu system, but most photo enthusiasts will just ignore these.The image sensor is fantastic, providing image quality on par with the very best DSLR's out there, even full frame. Within 30 minutes of owning the X-E1, I took the best pictures I ever have, and even more important my wife was able to reproduce the same results. A lot of this was also due to the 35mm f1.4 lens, but the simplicity of the camera and it's high quality sensor round out the picture.The build quality is top notch, with all the dials and buttons having great feel and positive feedback.The owners manual is a bit small so I downloaded the .pdf from Fuji's web site and loaded it into iBooks, now I just read it on the iPad, so size problem solved.This will be, I believe, my camera of choice for many years to come.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>You never really appreciate these things until you try them. Sitting in bed reading, it is difficult finding a comfortable position for my legs. One ankle on top of the other knee... straight out... both bent...just wasn't working. Using one of these in physical therapy, I found it highly comfortable and my legs weren't at all restless like they are in the sitting on a flat bed position. This particular wedge has three different angles/heights you can use. I don't see how anyone would say that it is too big, unless they are a &#34;small person&#34;... like 3' high. The shortest height/angle is only about 9&#34; high. I use the short side on my upper legs and the long side for my lower legs (opposite of the photo above). I am medium height but have a long torso and short legs for my height. It is only about 2&#34; wide, so it is not this &#34;huge&#34; thing on my bed. This is really going to help with my back and leg comfort as well. I only gave 4 stars because the it seems a bit soft - not sturdy enough to hold up to usage - and the cover isn't really a cover, but a &#34;pre-cover&#34; - very thin undercover, really should have something else to protect it.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>It was pretty good. What was there was pretty truthfull, there just wasn't anything really knew for me.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I've bought 2 of these. They are sturdy, have a wonderful finish, and have fit on every door I've tried them on. They are heftily made.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love my Gigaset phones which I've had for years and needed a new battery for one of the phones and found it here</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>When I showed them to our chef he couldn't tell the difference in the Reflections and real silver until he felt the weight! Great product!</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>This is a great DVD transfer of the non-stop special effects of Alien vs Predator (AVP). Enjoying even the great special effects of this film isn't enough to make for a really memorable sci-fi experience as it takes an engaging plot to make a good film, even in science-fiction.I don't believe anyone would think of this movie as part of the Alien series or try to compare it with prior Alien films. It obviously represents a \"knock off\" intended to attract from a large number of satisfied customers of the Alien vs Predator magazines. This doesn't mean that it shouldn't be considered good sci-fi film and I purchased the DVD hoping for a satisfying film experience.The story line does a nice job of connecting the film histories of the Alien and Predator races together and linking these two fictional accounts with the history of man on earth in a plausible way. Most people agree that the history of ancient monuments all over the earth appear to have a common link, which is probably one of the sources of the Atlantis myth.If anything I think AVP attempted to recapture the action and line up of good characters from ALIENS. Also, rather than the one-on-one bug hunt of the original film, this movie was about war between a defacto army of humans against an army of Alien creatures and their very dangerous Queen.In terms of special effects I would give this movie four stars, however, I couldn't get all that interested in the basic story and AVP left me with an overall one to two star impression and the feeling I was watching an animated comic book.I must admit that I never had the large screen theater experience and first saw the film on DVD at home. I assumed I would at least like AVP since I own the entire Alien series on DVD and enjoy seeing every one of them over and over again. However, I did find it worth watching and am looking forward to purchasing \"Alien vs Predator Requiem\"</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Build is very cheap but it needs to be so there is not a ton of extra weight on the camera.  You plug it in and it works perfect.  Great product!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought the TG3 primarily because of the ruggedization, GPS, Compass and Wi-Fi.  It also promised superior low-light perfomance. I have a couple of nice Nikon DSLR cameras but I don't like taking them in wet environments, and they are heavy. Received the TG3 yesterday and have tried it in all modes, including Wi-Fi in both iOS and Android with the Olympus Image Share Ap. Great images so far. The TG3 will fit in a large pocket and it is not as heavy as a DSLR so I will use it as a secondary camera. I have not tried it underwater and I will probably not do a drop test from seven feet. I need to study low light performance in more detail but it seems to work well. I will post some of my first photos on Flickr under VMI63 in an album labeled Olympus TG3.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love all of the &#34;Bourne&#34; movies.  I still watch them from time to time and still really enjoy them.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I just yardsticked 26 out from under my refrigerator! All my cats ABSOLUTELY LOVE their springs. I even buy extra packs and share with the kitties at the shelter where I volunteer.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Case fit to the phone is excellent. Leather feels good and overall case build is good except for the folding stand. The stand only works if you don't touch it. There is nothing to hold the phone if you touch it so don't buy this case if you want to use it as a stand.The 1520 phone is already large so overall this case doesn't add much to the overall size. There is nothing to hold the LCD cover in place, this is dangerous if you drop the phone the chances are high that the cover will not stay in place to protect the phone.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Contrary to what the picture on the labels implies, there aren't any meowing, cuddly kitten inside these cans! There's only mediocre fois gras in them. Two stars because my husband loves this fois gras on toast corners.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought this to replace an older IO Gear that wouldn't read 16GB SD Cards.  I love this model.  The fact that it has a slot for MicroSD cards built right into the side.Great card reader.  I don't see why anyone would want a card reader on the front of their computer.  This sits on my desk and isn't in the way.  It's perfect.Thanks Amazon and IOGear!</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>There are no holes drilled in the sides of this box only in the back, if I planned to mount it on the wall it would be perfect, but I want to recess the unit so I will have to modify the box and hope it does not void my warranty.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This Iphone case is fantastic. I just recieved it today and it is one of my favorite cases and I have quite a few. The color of the ribbon is more of a pink, pink then a baby pink. In the picture the pink color is lighter but when I received it it was slightly darker. I totally don't mind, I honestly love the actual color even better. The rhinestones have not fallen off yet and when I opened the package they were all still firmly glued on. The time it took to ship was longer than I hoped but it did come 5 days earlier that the estimated shipping arrival. I absolutley loved this case and I would definitely recommend this purchase and using this seller.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It is just the handiest and coolest thing to have in your bag for all kinds of emergencies that may arise.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Good deal for the money,if you know what to expect when you make your order and you know how to set up and use these speakers properly.

Probably would not order again.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Bought the camera just prior to Cancun vacation.  Should have paid more attention to negative reviews.Camera worked fine for exactly one day. Picture quality was outstanding.  By day two, functions stopped working and by day 3 it was useless, despite never taking deeper than a few feet, not dropping it, cleaning it per instructions, etc.I believe Panasonic has a serious quality control issue or a failed design issue.  No water visible anywhere inside the camera at any point but screen started blinking off and on every second, then video mode stopped working, followed by all menus failing to work, etc.  As stated, this camera takes a great picture, but it's got to work to do it and it obviously didn't.  Fortunately, we had several other regular cameras with us or just having this one would have been a real bust for pictures of our vacation.If Panasonic can fix whatever is causing these cameras to fail at a high rate, I would love to have it - but not as is.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>very good full in vitamin c i like the taste in my milk or smothies plus l use it for my mask with milk n aotmeal n is very good full in vitamin c it helps my to my face.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Other reviews suggest that the unit does what it is supposed to do.. The problem is the connector: they are all RCA, and the new plasmas or led/lcd tv's don't have RCA outputs.  Also, all installations require 2 cables, but only one is supplied.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Nice product! But the old glue bottle was way better to handle when you only need a little. I think its worth the money. Five stars for changing back to the old design!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Very nice little key safe unlocks without a key and combo super easy to change keeps the honest peolple honest but in a secure area it is perfect for keeping key organized and properly stored.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Recommend, an Excellent show.

Very deep bass, good mids, and crisp highs.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>While this is the exact item for the part number.  It is in no way a \"Kit\".  It is one bolt with one washer.The Dealer List price on this item is $2.82 and there are 5 other places that sell it from $1.79 to $2.02 each.  Even the amazon part number is deceptive \"ASIN: B0016IUXTS\" you think that just maybe the kit is all 16 bolts which are required to bolt on the transmission pan.Buyer be ware - thought I would never have to say that about amazon - sorry I had to.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I suppose it depends on what you are using this for. I wanted it to be able to seethe size # on sewing machine needles. It does not work for me. This is not the firstmagnifier I have purchased, for the purpose I want it for. No luck yet.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Flaws and all, this is one classic film, something for the time capsule. It's got it ALL, baby.Let's start with Rob Lowe. Jerry McGuire he ain't. You're never going to see Rob with tears streaming down his cheeks, telling a woman that she \"completes\" him. Rather, you're more likely to find him yanking his clothes out of the closet, pulling out any photos that include him, stuffing it all in a duffel bag and hurling it into a garbage truck as he leaves the former object of his desire alone and naked in bed...just like the opening minutes of \"Bad Influence.\"And yes, I know Rob has taken some \"serious\" roles and has played the \"good guy\" on occasion, but my challenge to you is \"NAME one of those roles.\" I remembered them at the time, and I've forgotten them, pretty much like every other Rob Lowe fan on the planet. We want Evil Rob, and this movie is Pure Evil Rob.I won't offer any spoilers here, but let's just say that if you can't see the major plot twist coming from a mile away, you haven't seen too many movies.James Spader seems like an odd choice to play Lowe's \"good\" doppelganger, the guy who becomes corrupted as Rob introduces him to his own wants and desires. Spader's starred in more than his fair share of \"this guy makes me feel kind of squirmy\" roles. Of course, the only way the corruption of the character's \"innocence\" can appear real is that if it's built on shaky foundations to begin with, and Spader nails it. His character is a \"career guy,\" a \"ladder climber,\" engaged to Marcia Cross, who equally nails the boring, white bread, \"why am I marrying this woman\" object of Spader's luke-warm desire. See, Spader really doesn't want the pot of gold at the end of his rainbow. He wants to ride around in  sporty little car with Evil Rob Lowe and do evil things. And he does. Why do you think the movie is named \"Bad Influence\" instead of \"Two Nice Guys Helping Others?\"The soundtrack is lip-smackin' 80s dee-licious, too. Lots of synthy angst...a highlight being The Nymphs performing \"The Highway\" during Lowe and Spader's first venture into one of the sleazy \"password at the door\" clubs. According to the notes on the YouTube clip of this scene, \"Inger Lorre wrote this song about Richard Ramirez, the \"Night Stalker,\" and the groupies he attracted during his trial.\" Makes it a perfect choice for this movie.I could go on...in detail...but I'm keeping my \"no spoilers\" promise. You probably have a general idea of what this one is all about, and I've tried to convey the flavor without ruining the experience. I love it, I've watched it at least 100 times since its release...it's a \"midnight movie,\" it's sublime junk, it's a career high for Lowe. He plays his character with such oily, unrepentant glee that you envy anyone having that much fun and getting paid for it.

This is one of the foods I rotate through. The tank gets about two large pinches when I feed, and they get this particular food about once a week (I also feed brine shrimp, flake, blood worms, algae wafers and more).The fish gobble this up quickly. I have never seen a shrimp be able to eat one before all the guppies hoover the little pellets up. The pellets/pieces are medium sized... a bit too big for fry under 2-3 weeks old.The container label lists the ingredients as: \"Fish meal, krill, corn meal, squid meal, wheat flour, earthworm meal, dried spirulina algae, wheat gluten meal, dried seaweed meal, dried yeast, squid liver meal, dicalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, dried mango...\" it goes on for awhile. I'm not entirely happy about seeing so much grain in the food mix. The container also says to feed as much in a day as the shrimp can eat in 2 hours.The expiration date is for 6/14. Being that I bought this about two months ago, it has roughly a 2 year shelf life. Good enough.All in all, I might not buy this again. The guy I bought my shrimp from said to just give them algae wafers every so often, and a bit of scallop once in a while as a treat. I don't think the shrimp will miss this. The guppies probably won't either. If I was keeping only shrimp I would buy it again, just to give the little guys some variety in their diet.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This air hose is a very good product at a good price...A little stiff on recoil but very functional...I am satisfied with it's performance...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>IT WAS A PERFECT MATCH FOR MY CAR.

This is a movie in search of a script.  I figured with Arkin and Falk it would have the same chemistry as \"The In-laws\" but it never gets off the ground.  It starts out like a parody of \"Double Indemnity\" and then goes haywire.  It could have been a screwball comedy but goes off in too many directions and just falls flat.  I gave it 2 stars because Arkin and Falk do some good acting, too bad they didn't have a good script.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The price was great, nice colors.  Can't have too many stylus's.

My sister was thirteen then. We took off the wrapper and the green gum taunted my taste-buds. We melted. I took out a piece and could smell it from two feet away. I have a good nose. I took off the wrapper and ever so gently put it in my mouth. I loved the taste!This gum has a green and silver package, also a silver wrapper. This gum has a very good texture; it is soft, actually chewable and delicious! As most already know this gum, as well as most gum, makes your breath smell good. Also it curves your hunger! It is also is very kid-friendly, great for the little ones.I love the flavor of this gum. Sweet mint is so delectable. Also I love this gum because it smells appetizing. I love how this gum last a long time. Another good thing about this gum is that it is sugar-free. This gum also lasts for around twenty minutes. This gum taste like ice-cream, but less cold. I love almost everything about this gum.Remember how I said ALMOST, the only thing I detest is how fast the flavor runs out after twenty minutes. That is just not long enough for me. It is better than nothing. Your spit affects your outcome. I mostly love this product!Kids love this, adults too! Gum chewers of all ages will love the sweetness of mint. People who seek flavor will seek this product. Mint lovers will fall in love. Ice-cream cravers who don't like the cold will crave this gum. Also this is good for women on diets.I've told you about my experience with the gum.  I've also told you about who may like it. Now go out and try it for yourselves! Go on now it is time to leave the nest!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>For the price, this phone case was great. It was gorgeous, I loved the design.

The Palm VII could get email, news, weather, taxi cabs, book hotels, lookup information in an online dictionary or encyclopedia, and do so much more.  The advantage was that these things could be done within seconds while driving down the highway, in the forest or wherever you were at.  I used this thing very heavily when I was on a vacation in Florida and did so much that would take forever to accomplish with a GPS, cell phone or device with a web browser.  The Palm VII lacked a browser because they are slow and take forever to get information over a device like this.So sad they had to discontinue Palm.net and so sad that the majority of people out there are so ignorant.

I think it is pretty cool.You can't turn furby off but you can put him to sleep. Put furby to sleep by leaving him in a dark room unattended for two minutes. Feed furby by putting your finger in his mouth and pushing on his tongue or you can feed him with the furby app.It is best to put rechargeable batteries in furby because he uses them quickly.All furbys are for ages 5 years and up. But some furbys might be better for younger children as furbys are all different colours and textures. For example, a white furby might be better for a young child and a black one for an older child because white furbys have longer fur and also they look a little different than black furbys.Furbys can change their personality suddenly. They might be a rock star personality and then they might close their eyes and move them quickly so it looks kind of like they are having a seizure and start saying '' me change '' and when they open their eyes and they are a valley girl!!!!!Furbys are AMAZING toys overall though.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>This drive arrived dead on arrival - not even a hum ...

Every once in a while, when the itch to \"live large\" needs a scratch, hey, get the band back together and hit the road for another \"greatest hits\" tour, supporting another \"greatest hits\" album.Well, all was fine and good until digital media upset the Apple cart. Now with the kids sharing their Bit-Torrent files across the web in their iTunes programs, nobody's selling units anymore. And every pimply teen with an iPad has every greatest hits compilation you could ever make. Now the only time the gravy train rolls into the station for elderly and burned out artists is a new tour. Watching these codgers drag themselves across the stage at your local highly-flammible nightclub borders on the inhumane. Instead of treasuring the music of your childhood, now you have to see it fumbled out from the arthritic fingers of your idols of yesteryear.This is all to give a little background to the sad story of REM and their latest merchandising play. While branching out like this is an ingenious way to avoid leaving the house (getting prescription refills for your hypertension and high cholesterol is such a pain on tour! And forget about dealing with the insurance coverage), I have to say that branding a nose hair remover with the previously solid \"Alternative\" brand of REM might have been a mis-step. I am sure that the band members love the product (when you get old, hair comes out of your nose, ears and other unexpected holes) but maybe they could have held out for a classier product- I mean, even that rapist Vince guy has the Slap Chop.Anyway, I'm sure the REM Nose Hair Pulling Spring is great; but don't expect it to bring you back to the magic teen years like listening to \"Document\" does.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is an amazing case!

Not the heavy duty model you find at the Gym, however for the money and home gym, it certainly seems solid enough.  I go about 185, and my son is 210.

I think it is rated to 250, but am confident it would support more.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Great wireless printer, prints from our cell phones and laptops.

I am generally a fan of Logitech products, and when I went looking for a quality headset for my laptop, I bought this headset with confidence.  And I loved it for about 3 uses before the USB connector buckled after I brushed it against the arm of my chair.  I don't believe I've ever seen a USB connector this poorly constructed.  Standard construction is very durable, and Logitech must have really been cutting costs with this design.  It makes me wonder if Logitech is now just phoning in their product designs, coasting on their reputation.  Sad.  Logitech lost a loyal customer with this one.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I absolutely love this bedspread! The size is awesome. Most are way too short all the way around for a kingsize bed but this one fits great! It's even longer than I really need but that's better then too short! I am very pleased with this purchase! The color is perfect; more of an aqua which is really what I was hoping for rather than green that the picture shows. Thanks!!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>this seems to help!

This is excellent protection and ensures your screen remains pristine.  On the other side of this case is a larger compartment which holds the other accessories, like the cables, the charging unit, and the gimble assembly used to attach the unit to the windshield or dash.  It makes for a very tidy small package that keeps all the necessary stuff in one place, plus it's a quality pouch that reflects the name of Garmin!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>As I write, Kansas City just got hammered with snow.  Our area (SW WI) received approx 5 inches.  I ordered this last week & it arrived on Tuesday.  Excellent packaging.  I am not &#34;mechanically inclined&#34; but I had the machine unpacked and running in about 10 minutes.  Very simple.Used it for the first time and it did a great job.  Throws the snow pretty far.  The chute stayed in place.  I just had to watch out for the extension cord.The snow was heavy but not wet-that's why I went 4 instead of 5 stars-hasn't been &#34;battle tested.&#34;  If I can use it-you can use it.  Great little machine.  Better value than the &#34;$400&#34; gas monster on clearance at the lumber store.Highly recommended.  Love it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Ordered this to match the Danze Parma shower fixture in our guest bath. Matches nicely - cohesive look. Our plumber installed it without incident (that I know of). Looks and works great. Feels solid in your hand when you turn it on and off. It was so much easier and cheaper to order from this site than it was to get it at Home Depot, who I believe actually makes this. Ironic.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I got this after having such a hassle loading the bobbin on my old, inherited sewing machine. It was &#34; portable&#34; for its time weighing in a light 40 pds. I nearly threw a disk in my back dragging it out to sew. I eventually became so fed up, I stopped sewing. My daughter recently jumped on the sewing band wagon I had been searching for a replacement for a while when this happen to go on Black Friday sale. I was super excited that it had the self loading bobbin.I love that the machine is light weight! I can pick it up with one hand!I also love the bobbin and self threading needle feature- what a time saver!My 9 yr old already has the hang of doing everything herself, which is awesome!My only complaint is the thread bunches up under the fabric sometimes while sewing. Its a minor inconvenience, but maybe it has to do with the type of thread. I am really happy with this machine and glad I bought it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Perfect fit for My 2009 Altima , easy to install. Three is a you tube video that shows how to install.  A few more words.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The Tire Pressure Monitoring System is a great idea. While some newer cars have something like this built in, it's great for older cars and would be ideal for an RV or trailer to prevent any issues on a long trip. The car on which I've used the system has steel valve stems, so I haven't had any issues with losing air pressure or damage to the valves.The thing I liked the least was the installation. There is no way I could have figured out how to install the system from the documentation supplied. I had to get help from someone who is very familiar with the set up of electronics, such as navigation systems, and even he had to muddle through to figure out how to complete the set up due to the poor documentation. One issue we had is that one of the tires we wanted to monitor was already low in pressure and the system wouldn't pick that tire up during the set up.I like the design of the system itself. The monitor can be closed while driving, and then the driver only needs to worry about it if the green light changes to yellow or red. When the car is stopped, the screen can be reviewed to view the details on whatever problem is being detected. In addition, the monitor will sound an alarm for any of the \"red\" warnings.I have found it to be a useful system and would definitely find it useful for an RV or if hauling a trailer. (Note:  The manual says in some cases a \"repeater\" accessory is needed if a vehicle is over a certain length or something is being towed.)</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>works well on my kayak and has decent sound for the size</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>this ONLY catches large debris.  I use it while running the pool vacuum and found that if I place a knee high hose inside, it will catch the majority of debris.

I'm not an audiophile and don't have a Technics 1200 to compare it to, but I do have ears and eyes and hands.  First of all, this unit looks good.  I may be biased because I've wanted a new turntable for over a year and I chose the AT-LP120 very early on in my research, but it does look nice.  I have a couple of friends that DO have the 1200MK2, and they like this turntable.  One of them purchased a 120 to use every day and... because it has the USB out.  He calls it a 1200 clone.  Second, if you pick it up, you'll feel the substantial weight which undoubtably lends to it's steadiness and (so far) unwaivering spin rate.  My old turntable, a Technic SA-202 I've had since 1982, has served me well and still serves as the party starter in the garage (next to the bar and milk crates full of records).  Had to move it down there when the other TT crapped out over 5 years ago, so you can see I really needed a new living room unit.  And of course sound wise, the new AT-LP120 does not dissapoint.  But again, maybe my opinion is biased, because I just love to play an album.  I like sliding out the liner, then the record, smell of the vinyl, slight static that raises the hair on my arms, using the discwasher, then placing the arm manually and hearing that &#34;thump&#34; as the needle settles into the groove.  Then sitting back and listening to a whole side, where I'm not clamoring to find a new song or jumping ahead with a touch screen &#34;click&#34;, is much more enjoyable. You could buy this turntable because it's a good deal, really, for what I paid for the 202 in 1982 (just over $200) you can have a greatly superior model.  But if you're like me, you'll buy it for the experience, it can't be beat.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have used this brand for several years and highly recommend them.

I had to cover up the holes on the sides of the pots with some white duct tape to keep the sandy soil from washing out, and also line the bottom of the pot with a layer of sphagnum moss since there are so many holes in the bottom, but other than that, it seems to be working out great so far.  I wanted something white so it wouldn't heat up as much in the sun, and I can fit two rows of these pots side by side under my fluorescent grow lights when I need to bring the plants inside over the winter to keep them from freezing.  I just ordered a second batch of them so I can finish transplanting the rest of my flytraps.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This film is an excellent introduction to the history of the Palestine Israeli struggle.  It is the historical information that most United States citizens are unfamiliar with that ultimately determines where justice lies (just as it did in South Africa and in the American south) and makes the current situation so obviously fascist.  This must stand as basic essential information and arguments over details can only be secondary.  This should be shown in every high school in America.  Bush's rhetoric about honoring UN resolutions is also shown to be just  so much more deceit from the US leadership...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>at first start up i thought crap the pipes are loud(compaired to stock),.but after a few trips they are awesome. really nice deep idle for a 883..chrome is great ..straight bolt on no issues</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I recommend this product to anybody who has an ES-339 or an Ultra 339.

Automatic worldwide voltage.  I've been recharging every 7 to 10 days.  On/off button easy to press.The packaging was horrible, a welded clamshell.  Used a box cutter, scratched a finger while pulling it out.  It takes some effort to attach and remove the charging cord.  Charging cord is not coiled.  The wall plug is ok, not as big as others I've had.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have been woodworking for 2 years and I purchased a grizzly 6'' jointer about 6-8 months after I started woodworking and I always had problems trying to set the straight blade height correctly, which got old very quick so I bit the bullet and purchased the byrd cutterhead. It took me about 4 hours to install and align to outfeed table and let me tell you WOW I don't have to wear earplugs it is so quite and what a awesome cut on any wood. Know I don't have to worry about setting blades,just unscrew turn 90 degrees and screw back in and the jointer is ready to go. I also purchased new bearings just in case but had no problem with the old ones since the machine was only 1 1/2 yrs. old, if you don't have anything to pull the bearings off with go to autozone as the rent pulley pullers which work great to pull off the pulley and bearings. I am now saving up to put a byrd cutterhead on my planer</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I wouldn't purchase these again nor would I recommend them to someone. I used them a few times in weather that wasn't extreme cold and they did very little to keep my fingers warm. I have a form of Raynaud's disease and I was hoping these gloves would help to ride in the spring and fall. When these Firstgear heated gloves failed to work I went out and purchased Harley-Davidson's Women's Dual-Source Heated Gloves (Part Number 98231-12VW). Now those gloves ROCK. I am super happy with the performance of the HD gloves and I have been riding all winter using them. I can finally ride year round. I had contacted the seller about getting a refund and they were not at all cooperative and handed me off to their supplier. However the initial supplier of the Firstgear Warm gloves was excellent and tried to do everything in their power to make me happy with the product. I would definitely consider purchasing these gloves from a different seller.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It's probably the best knife you can get for under $10. Very much worth the price. But remember that your getting a $10 knife.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I am not afraid to admit that I think Nick Nolte is one of the most overrated actors of his generation, but I think that he was really good in &quot;The Good Thief&quot;, because he was playing someone so close to himself in real life. A burnt out junkie who is closer to the end of his career than the beginning seems to fit him perfectly.This movie is a heist movie to begin with, and director Neil Jordan shoots it with the appropriate glitz and glamour that a film set in Monte Carlo deserves. He nails the atmosphere, giving the movie a dark, jazzy feel, mixing the styles of the classic films noir and the new reinvention of the style. The plot is good, as it is filled with twists and turns, as any good heist flick should. One thing that should be mentioned is the chemistry between all the characters. The cast is completely European, save Nolte, yet they mesh incredibly well together. The relationship between Bob and Roger the police officer is one of the movie's centerpieces, and their mutual respect and odd friendship is completely believable without too much explanation. Also good in this movie is the girl who plays Anna, and I won't even attempt to spell her name, because it could take up to an hour to get it right. She is as throaty as she is innocent, yet there is an obvious dark side to her character, one that often shines brighter than the innocence of a seventeen year old runaway.Aside from the crime side of the movie, &quot;The Good Thief&quot; is about rebirth, in all of the characters. They are all ressurecting themselves from their past lives, trying to make good on the lives that still lay ahead of them. All in all, this is a good movie, and should entertain most people who are into this genre until the exciting end.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I am using this on my new sirius satellite radio, and I got what I was expecting and works great!!!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This carafe has been a great addition to my home. I have used it at dinner, and even at my bedside so that I have easy access to fresh cold water all night long.The outside is a stylish red, much less pink than it looks in the picture. The handle is coated in a rubbery grip which makes it easy to hold onto. To pour you simply depress the button on the top and the water flows. The top is easy to screw on and off easily. The inside is solid glass. I love that my water is being stored in glass and not plastic. While this makes the carafe heavy, it is worth it to me.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Well, exactly like I said in the title...the app is nice and my 3 1/2 year old daughter seems to like using it, but stylus does not work with the otterbox defender.

Most said \"Good basic toaster oven for the price\", and that is certainly true. It toasts, bakes and broils...and that is it! If you just want a basic model toaster oven without all of the extras, and for not a lot of money, buy this one.But, if you aren't a patient person, do not buy this toaster oven because it really seems to take a while to toast. The dial where you have to turn it to the right and then to to the left for your desired setting also takes a while to get used to, but once I had it figured out it makes a perfect piece of toast.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Very easy to install - just insert the HDMI plugs for the sources and the television.

Just like the one I had when I was 7, only much better!!  The detail is amazing.  No dumb battery compartments for the \"lights and sound\" features--because there aren't any.  The panels pop off for battle damage and have, so far, stayed on when I wanted them to.  The old one I had would blow the panels off after enough playtime and would really bother me after a while because you would just set the thing down and the panels would pop off.  Man, I hated that!!  This one doesn't seem to have that problem yet.  The color of the ship is nice and the price isn't TOO bad where you couldn't buy 2 or 3 to have a nice, little fleet.  I think you do NOT have to buy the X-wing to go with this because the Red Leader X-wing fighter is a much better toy to buy.  The detail is way better and it just looks better.  These classic Star Wars ships are loads of fun and can stand the test of time.  I loved them 30 years ago and my kids love them now.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Keeping in mind I've been a licensed A&P mechanic during my entire working life and I'm fairly smart, I found the assembly easy and well engineered however, some may not. I was able to make certain assumptions and observations because of my background and had no difficulty putting things together. The finish is durable and resists everything I've done to it so far.. Design and placement of drawers, shelves, etc. works good for me. Packaging was well thought out too. Even if you're not mechanically inclined, by taking your time, fitting panels and lining up holes before you do any changing, things go together as advertised...at least mine did.  It is the best assembly required computer desk I've ever had.

The only issue I have with it is that the black eyeshadow gets mixed up w/ the base and I end up having to wipe off a lot of base with a tissue or qtip before I can use it, because it gets mixed up in there.I think the quality of the makeup is quite good.  When I put it on exactly how Lauren does in her youtube video, it lasts all day!I really love it for travel, though.  All I have to take now is foundation, mascara, some loose powder, and this!  No more multiple bottles and compacts of various colors.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Typical otterbox quality. Durable and stylish. This fits very comfortably in men's khakis or cargo shorts.

The difference in just a few days was remarkable in terms of softness and body, not to mention maximum colour retention - something that has been plauging me, especially over the summer months.Recommend to purchase, irrespective of the price.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Sad, the stand that makes this case great. Unfortunately it broke the first time I used it.  bummer!  Can this great idea be produced at a fair price?  Oh well back to the other case.....</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This inexpensive webcam works with older Macs lacking webcams, without the need to install drivers.  Just plug it in, set your preferences, and you immediately get an image.  The camera lens needs to be focused manually, which is a little tricky but does allow the use of a less wide angle lens.  The quality of the image is ok - not as crisp as that of the built-in powerbook cameras. The color accuracy varied considerably between the two computers I tried with it.  Coupled with iGlasses software, I was able to get a fairly acceptable palate on both machines. The built-in microphone seemed to work well.  Overall, it is an acceptable camera at about $30, and fills a void for Mac users, who need a camera a low cost.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Couldn't find the right shade of this produce for my skin tone in the stores. After receiving my True Match blush and have been using it daily, I am really happy with it. Blends perfectly and is just the shade I needed.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Treat bags for a class party, wedding favors, birthday party goody bags -- this is your answer for cute and customizable -- and easy! Just use the pre-made templates to add your custom text and graphics, and print away. But print a test sheet first to make sure everything's spelled correctly. :)</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Not a lot to say about these.  They are staples and they work in the Porter-Cable US58 that I bought with them. They go nicely into wood frames and molding.  I would not hesitate to buy them again.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Good product for the price. I use it on tables at restaurants when my 7 month old is in a highchair. As long as you wet the suction cup and push it down firmly, it holds very well. My son can pull it off when he is determined. But I am always sitting next to him when he is playing. It does a good job of keeping him entertained and distracted at meals so I can have some adult conversation.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought these adapter plugs because I was going to Europe from America and I wanted to be able to plug stuff in.  By &#34;stuff,&#34; I mean my laptop, my electric shaver, my iPhone charger, and a 1980s boombox that I travel with at all times just to keep things chill and fresh.  My goal was to be able to plug things in while in Germany--but also while in the Netherlands.  And I was successful.  Are there other adapters out there that can do the same thing?  Probably.  Are they cheaper?  Maybe--but these were under $7.  So I would call this a 5 star purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Had a terrible flea infestation, bought this product and almost overnight the fleas were gone. 5 stars for sure! Don't hesitate to buy!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I spent several decades slinging around large bags of as many as three age-specific formulations at a time, depending on the makeup of my family. I can't do that anymore and I was happy to find the &#34;all life stages&#34; formulation, guess we've come full circle from when I was young and all dogs of whatever age ate the same thing. Anyway, the bottom line was would they eat it. Resounding yes! Rip, the old boy, bolted his down (one of the reasons I like small nuggets) and then was snacking out of the bag until I closed it, at which point he lay down right by the bag. That was a couple of bags ago and they continue to eat it happily. No digestive difficulties that I'm aware of and I do keep up with stuff like that.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These are very handy to have for use with the bassinet changing table so it is not cold in the middle of the night.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Pictures are hit an miss. Has some nice features, but the camera just doesn't take quality pictures on a consistent basis.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>THIS IS GREAT, IT SEALS PERFECTLY AND EVEN FLOATS (BLACKBERRY 9360  (TRY IT BEFORE) ....ITS A GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE...</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Setup was a bit difficult, and now that it's installed, I can't always get it to work properly. When it does, I can get the same results from either my Tivo or my blu ray player.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Needed more storage for camera this was about one third the price at the big box stores I' very pleased.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I've had these for a few weeks. I absolutely  Love them! I've had great results  each time i use them.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I ordered this as a replacement to our occasional pizza nights on the weekends now that I am cutting gluten from my life. I have had gluten free pizza one other time at a pizza joint and thought I couldn't make something as delicious at home. The dough was easier to work with than I expected. It only rises a little bit and instead of cutting it in two I made one large 16&#34; pizza. Just make sure to spray down your pizza pan with pam or similar type spray and get a bowl of warm water to keep your hands wet so the dough is easier to work with. I followed the instructions to a &#34;T&#34; (other than adding seasoning to the crust before the initial cooking to make it more flavorful) and ended up with an amazing gluten free pizza even my picky husband loved! It doesn't taste like the typical greasy pizza hut type pizza but if you enjoy gluten free pizza you will love this! I will be buying more at this price soon, it's way cheaper than order out and much better for you.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The belt is ok...the attachments are fairly worthless.  The radio holster is a complete and total waste of material, not holding the radio in place at all!  I am a corrections officer and need a very sturdy holster that can withstand heavy usage and lots of jiggling around when it comes to walking up and down top tiers for count, etc.  The cuff case is a bit too rigid, hard to snap shut but the speed loader case works well.  Overall, this gets an &#34;eh&#34; rating from me.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have had psoriasis of the scalp for over 7 years with no help.  I have tried all lotions, creams, shampoos and sprays.  Most were prescription and cost sometimes $ 300 plus.  I never saw any improvement.  My psoriasis was so bad, I was ashamed to go get my hair cut. I scratched constantly, I even took Humira which did not help.  One washing and I could tell the difference immediately.  I only wash my hair 2-3 times per week and my scalp is great.  I do have one pesky spot, just a little longer with the shampoo and it clears up.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>The stars are nice quality and although it's a pain to have to individually put putty on each one before sticking them on the ceiling, they stick well and don't fall off. However, the whole point of the ceiling stars is to glow in the dark, and these only glowed for about five minutes before fading out. And this is after an entire day of sunlight in the desert, so they had plenty of light to absorb. Disappointing, because they seemed really nice.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Well worth the money.  The biscuits are strong and hold on the glue as they should.  Well worth the money for the amount you get and I'll order these again.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Timely shipping was great. The lights were simple to install and they look great on my truck. Can't wait to get the head lights too.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Tasty, healthy and it doesn't sit in my stomach like a rock like oatmeal or cream-of-wheat. This is now my breakfast staple!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>We bought this bubble wrap to protect our things for a move.  It was definitely thick enough and the sheets were large enough for most items.  When we packed our plates and other kitchen items, we placed a sheet between each item.  Nothing broke in the move, which was at least in part due to the quality of the bubble wrap.My only complaint:  The perforations were not always effective, so sometimes we had to search or just rip the wrap where we thought there should be a perforation.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This scale is nice but it keeps telling me I have the body of a 52 year old.  There is no way to adjust for a body builder trying to get acurate info.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I ordered this flat iron after checking out the current reviews, and I must say I am in love! Because they are titanium I mainly use them for my natural Indian sew ins and not on my natural hair because of the amount of heat they emmit. They are quick to heat up and I love them! I would definitely suggest buying them! In addition to the product being great, the flat irons shipped and arrived extremely quickly!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I give this party decoration a 10!  It reminds me of where I came from and I am still young enough to enjoy it.  I may live in Canada but I do miss England.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We have a Schnauzer who suffers with anxiety when the groomer comes via \"Goin to the Dogs\", we give her one of these tablets and now the groomer says, \"I can clip her nails without the muzzle on\".............mission accomplished!!  Thank you</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I ordered this from E.l.f I was so excited when it arrived! soooo many colors. Well I promptly cleaned my face added E.L.F eyelid primer (I love this primer most of all the primers I've tried even, high end primers) and my excitement fizzled drastically. The pigments are awful, even using a wet eyeshadow brush I had to use a lot to get relatively close to what I wanted for color on my lids. If you want decently pigmented large eyeshadow pallets go with NYX or sephora brand pallets. Even for the mere 15$ I paid I wouldn't suggest this item, but I will however regift this to my mother in law hahahaha</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Awesome guy - Awesome Music!  Dwight is one of my husband's favorite country singers, and he was very happy for the download.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These bars are wonderful! Sort of a \"Good for you\" candy bar. They are a bit pricey but oh so good!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Last summer (08)I purchased a 18x52 pool at CostCo. It came with a totally inadequate pump. (Intex 635 ) I went through at least 20 A type filters and no mater how many times Skimmed, cleaned, shocked and chlorinated there was a slimy film on the floor and sides of the pool. The replacement pump that I ordered is outstanding. all I can say is WOW!! I can actually see the water moving. I have it set on a timer, let it cycle for 2-3 hour and the water is crystal clear. I tested the water today and no bacteria found.  AWESOME pump!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I have extremely curly hair & this stranger works wonders! Most straighteners you'd find at a store like Walmart or Target that range from $30-90 can't straighten my hair without leaving it frizzy & puffy; but this stranger eliminates all that. It leaves my hair starlight & smooth. My fianc&eacute; & run his fingers through it even! This straighter does make cute flips in my hair but it's shape doesn't allow it to make curls like some other straighteners I've had in the past. Overall it does a great job at straightening!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I am a big man, and have trouble getting chairs that hold up.  This one is made stronger than the other big man chairs I have had.  My only question is if the gas shock will hold up over time, but usually that is not a problem with other chairs that do not fasten the same way as this one that has pockets to hold the shock, rather than just a simple hole in the wheel section and seat section.  The chair fits well, and so far is holding up well and appears to be solid.  I was worried about the seat between the armrests, but they are a little adjustable, about two or three inches on each arm.  I am considering ordering another chair just like this one.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These bottles are great, we also got the large ones as well. They warm easily, are easy to wash and sterilize. Our son has no complaints either. I would recommend buying the silicone sleeves, it makes gripping them more easy and you don't worry about it slipping out of your hand.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My 7 year old son is OBSESSED with sharks.  He saved up his allowance until he had enough to order this.  When it came we were so impressed with the quality and value.  Our 3 year old fell in love with it, so we got one for him for Christmas.  ;)</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This dresser looks very nice and sturdy but it took my very capable son a good part of the afternoon to put it together.  I am very pleased with the product though.It also arrived very fast after ordering, which was nice.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The product came as expected and has been doing the job perfectly.I would buy again when the need arises.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I use this little helper with painting and typing and cooking. It is small enough to not be in the way on a desk or counter top or next to my easel. It will hold 8 1/2 x 11 paper straight up and great with recipe cards etc. LOVE IT! I even took a picture of this to our local Staples store so they would carry them. Was happy to have found more on Amazon.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I really LOVED these headphones, but after a couple of months using them for my runs, they up and died.  As others have reported here, they don't seem to deal with sweat very well after time.  If you're not going to exercise in them, then they are nice, otherwise, look elsewhere.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is just what I needed and it is working just fine on my frig.  This is a very easy way to order and get this when i need it</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Bought because my fingers were somehow too big to play scrabble on my Kindle.These were the perfect size for the game and now I use them for absolutely everything.Multiple Colors in the package was perfection because now everyone has their own personal stylus.Another huge plus is that dirty finger splotches aren't all over my touch screen!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I must say I fell in love the moment it turned on. No dead pixels, awesome colors and sharpness just as expected and no backlight bleeding or anything. And for this price, come on! This can't get any better. If you are still thinking abut buying this, just stop thinking and hit the ORDER button NOW. 30\" S-IPS monitor at this price pretty much beats all the competition including Dell U3014 and the likes. Colors were just about perfect right out of the box.Make sure your computer graphics card has DVI-D output to experience the full capability of this monitor.Don't let the shipping from Korea fool you either. I ordered this monitor Thursday late at night, received it Tuesday morning!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These headphones are truly amazing. Like lots of other reviews said, you hear instruments and sounds in songs you've never heard before with other Headphones. These go over your entire ear so after long periods of usage, your ears get a little hot. Other than that, these are amazing headphones.Pros:-comfortable-portable-amazing sound quality-very balanced sound-good looking-good price for awesome headphonesCons:-Ears get a little warm after extended use.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought this as a gift for my son. He needed a durable time piece for his job and this fits the bill.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Just read his reiew below mine...too lasy to write right now.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I guess you get what you pay for.With thud one the cover doesn't stay on and tha swing cover barely moves.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I am 26 years old and I have been shaving primarily with Braun since I started shaving. I had Braun (model 6520), which I got for my 18th birthday, and it lasted me almost 8 years. Throughout the 8 years, I changed foil only once. The old model gave me a shave whose closeness was competitive to manual razors.Finally I decided to get this new model. While it's not perfect, it comes very close to it. It gives a closer shave than my older model, provides a softer feel while shaving and does it faster. It still leaves room for improvement, such as providing a better shave in the neck area, but its performance is still much improved over older models.I cannot say that I shaved with many good manual razors, like Mach III or others, the ones I did shave with, didn't actually provide a better shave than this electric model. Of course the big plus with electric is that it  doesn't cut my skin like razors do. Moreover, it's faster and without any mess.It should be noted that face should be dry prior to shaving, or else shave will not be nearly as close. All in all, it's a great product in terms of performance, reliability and comfort.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We exchanged 3 regular 100 watt light bulbs down the center of our garage with 12 foot ceilings, and what a great difference these bulbs make.  The GE-Reveal are among some of the brightest lights for the price, and the energy savings make them a superior choice for large areas.  Just bought 6 more to finish out the 27x30 garage area we need to brighten up.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>We got these for our grill with a few other replacement parts as a package. However they were a bit too long compared to previous ones so husband had to trim them to fit.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Great fit, and we like the two D clips since it keeps harness on even if the clasp breaks</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Despite watering well in the fall, spraying with anti-dessicant AND wrapping three layers deep I lost nearly $700 in yews a white pine trees this past winter!!!  Adding insult to my injury, the manufacturer refused to even discuss my situation or at least refund the money spent on this horrible product.  Back to burlap, which worked fine on the same plants for 6 years...wished there was a zero star rating!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love this blend. Just right. Not too strong but with a rich, bold flavor. Always my first choice from the basket.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Needed to add an extra set of FW ports on a different bus to my Mac Pro.  This works like a champ!  No drivers necessary - works OoB. It also uses a TI 1394 chipset, which is typically the &#34;holy grail&#34; for Mac compatibility & stability.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>this case fits well & we like it.  We have not tried to remove it.  it is pretty. it comes in two pieces & snaps on.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Very nice rich color - slightly reddish, sturdy, and surprisingly comfortable.  Overall a very nice product and easy to put together.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Really really fun game to play. i never get sick of it. after you get the hang of aiming for the can the game gets great.  the only bad thing is that the frisbee is a little heavy and thick compared to others.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Looks so professional and can be used instead of a pre-printed more expensive version. Thanks again and I will keep ordering it</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Very nice and thick. I like how the leather is muted and there is no branding on the back.I may have to return this one since my watch is 19mm and not 20mm.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The lowest angle is 20 degrees, and it can be adjusted up to the maximum angle of 60 degrees in 10 degree increments.The base and the top portion are both  12 cm (4.7 in) by 8 cm (3.1 in.  They snap together at the top to stay closed when you are not using it.  When closed, the total depth is 4.1 cm (1.6)  (including the lip to hold the device).The gap (lip) that the device fits into is 2.1 cm (.82 inches).  My Nexus fits into it while in the case (Devicewear The Ridge Red Vegan Leather Six Position Case with Flip Stand for Version 1 2012) easily.The back and bottom are metal mesh.  The lip and edges are hard plastic.It does not slide at all when being used, due to the four rubber bump feet.This is an excellent device for smaller tablets and smartphones but I would not call it easily portable. I would not want to throw it in my purse.  The main advantages over a case with an included stand are the ability to use it in portrait mode and the ability to securely adjust the viewing angle.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These food groups are designed well, durable, look great, and my LO loves them.  She enjoys taking them out of the crates and putting them back in, in addition we like to set up little picnic's with them as well.  The milk carton and chicken drumstick are a little heavy for now, but she will grow into them.  Overall, we are very happy with our purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I used to do partial water change in my 100g at least once every week to get it crystal clear.  With this and Seachem's matrix I now only do water change once every 3 weeks or so.  This is so much worth the price because it saves so much time from doing water changes.  If you want nice clear water get this plus the seachem matrix.  This stuff is re-usable so you can use it forever.  And don't forget to buy the bag to put this stuff in.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I  have a all white Malshi and this stuff is amazing!!! After a good daily dose I realized though once a week worked just fine. He has not had those ugly brown spots on his eyes since I used this. I highly recommend this product.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This item was the perfect thing I was looking for. I was able to get the item fast, as described without any problems!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It is the better of the coffees that I have tasted - not too strong.  And it gets here on time</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is great!  It was a gift for my son and he was thrilled with it.  Thanks so very much.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>took a while to get here and only a few of them are ajustable but other than that they were pretty nice</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is only my 3rd or 4th review for Amazon, submitted because these are a GREAT deal. Some said they were &#34;poor&#34; quality / NOT. Heavy duty, not the elcheapo styles that break on opening. They were in 2 boxes with bubble wrap all around, none are cracked as some said. BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU NEED FULL SIZE CD JEWEL CASES........BUY THESE. I got 100 and will be ordering 200 more.....................</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I bought this Root Styler to use when I do my keratin hair treatments. More specifically I bought this product to help with my coarse roots and edges smooth in between relaxing. I give this flat iron a 4 star rating because it does get very hot and did work well to tame my edges and roots.The only reason I gave the four star rating is because this product should be redesigned to include teeth for combing as you flat iron as well as thinner, flatter arms so for a closer, optimal root straightening. Other than that this is a great product.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The tool is very good in term of durability.  However, the accessory the came with the tool is crappy.  The bi-metal blade barely cut two nails and then refuse to work.  The other one (the wider one) even worse, only cut wood and got dull very fast.  You need to buy a set of other accessory almost at the same time when you buy the tool. Never the less, even plus the cost of an accessory kit ($20), the tool ($35) is still not too bad.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>What can I say we all need a good mouse pad. This one looks and works great. It looks 3 D and I enjoy just looking at it.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I bought this toy in hopes of helping my cat to be more active, but he has shown zero interest in playing with it. All he does is stick his nose in the middle to smell the catnip. I realize this has something to do with my cat's personality, but I was hoping to find a toy that would engage his interest! If you have a lazy cat, this toy is probably not going to change that. I think I need to get something that moves on its own that he will be interested in chasing.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>ok maybe 21. The headphone opening is big enough in 60% of the cases but I have a bunch of speakers with aux cords and some are a little bit. But still manages to fit ok! Just squishes the case2. More seriously, the charging port could be a little more spacey. It's better than another case I had but it could just be a little bit bigger! It's a problem on occasionOverall, everythings good. The button access on the sides is perfect and this case has a very nice and slim fit with a perfect amount of tack for grip on most surfaces but not too much to pull your pockets inside out when getting your phone.Seems like a pretty solid case! It'll def save your phone but if you expect often and hard falls, maybe get a bulkier and sturdier case. I take really good care of my phone so this is just to rescue from a few drops and nothing crazy. Just waist level drops to the floor.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>As far as quality, this is what I expected from a store-bought costume. The issue with this item is the size. My daughter is 19 months old and very small for her age and this costume was just the right size for her, despite being a Toddler 2-4 size. Perhaps the item I received was missized; however, even for a 1-2 size it was smaller than I hoped. The hat was WAY too small, so I had to make adjustments by cutting it so that it would fit on her head. Other than the sizing issues, the costume is what I was looking for and met my expectations.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My Pussycat came to us with very-very severe Ring Worm.  After 12 bi-monthly washings, the nasty stuff was killed.  This product smells nice and didn't seem to bother JasPurr when he was being washed.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>It is not bad but be sure your gun has or doesnt have a plug in the handle by the clip my s&w sigma does and i had to trim the grip to fit if you dont have the plug it will work great good product if made for your pistol i learned the hard way.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>i spent 20 or so years of my life trying to find the perfect shampoo for my very samoan thick and coarse hair....this is perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is a great product. Purchased two of those, one for home and one for work. Satisfied in both cases.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This product works as advertised. I have a new Homelite gas trimmer with a curved shaft and what used to take me nearly a full \"roll\" of line with the old bump and feed method I did with only two 5 inch pieces. I had to \"rig\" the end of it a little to make the retro-fit tight on the the head of the trimmer but other than that, this is the easiest and best product I have ever used for trimming. I highly recommend this product if you have a lot to trim like I do as it will save you a ton of time and even more frustration.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I am normally not a person who writes reviews but after I received the product I felt it is important for me to write for this one.I am a fashion blogger and and take most of my photos through my phones. As most people would know, the camera totally drains the battery and I hate the big and bulky chargers that most other brands have which does not fit my style. When I first saw the LUXA2 brand I was hesitated a little bit because it is not a really well known brand, however, after I received the product, the quality, functionality and style totally surpassed my expectation !!First of all .. IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU !! you will not look bad when you pull this out in the public ..Secondly, it charges FAST !! sometimes it even feels like faster than wall charger ! ( exaggerated a little bit there but you know what I mean when you are on the road ) ..Third .. some people might see it as a negative star but I actually like the weight of it because I can feel the quality built of the overall product !!Even though there are so many others out there but I think LUXA2 is definitely on to something in this competitive market !! I will need to buy another one soon because it seems like my wife is eyeing on it ... LOL</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Concentrate works just as well as the bona spray that came with my original kit. Very easy to mix and store. A good bit cheaper than pre-duluted alternatives.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I first visited Radio Shack, which not only did not stock this item but said they had never seen one.  The on line purchase was fast, economical, and everything fit/worked perfectly.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This flashlight is amazing. Tough, durable, and holds a charge for quite a while. Shipping was very fast. Just the sound of the stun gun part is scary.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These are great bibs especially for the price. I liked the first 10 so much that I ordered 10 more. If you expect a bib to last all day with a teething infant then....you must be a first time parent. Enjoy your new baby, but change the bib a few times a day....especially after meals.The best part about these bibs is that liquid stays on the front and doesnt soak through. They also hold up well in the wash.I would not hesitate to say that these are the best bibs available for the money.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Cheap, cheap  cheap  and cheap.  It is true, you pay for what you get.  Ended up purchasing a different one.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>still in trial period.  takes about 10 days according to instructions.  works fine, just have to wait for correct period to prove effictiveness.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This product was great for the price. It looks really fancy. I like it.  Delivery took a while but it was okay for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I purchased two of these for my average round-bowl home toilets. The back of the seat was narrower than the rim of the toilet, and it was unsightly. They're going back. Other than that, I thought they were well made, if on the small side of regular round toilet seats.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>We bought 2 of these for fun-loving adults. We shot at ourselves and visitors, and had a blast. Easy to use, but not rapid fire. Good for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Excellent sleeping bag. Lightweight for the warmth it's capable of providing. Plenty of room at legs to roll over and sleep on your side. With the extra space in the legs it can get cold spots, however this is remedied by stuffing a jacket or any extra clothing in there. The attached hood provides added warmth and keeps you tucked in all night.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I placed each of these batteries into my 2 post cap solar lights. One of the 2 batteries worked and the other lasted for about 2 weeks, then it died. By the time I installed them and let them run for a couple of weeks, it was past the 30 day warranty so I am stuck. (My last batteries lased for 2 years!) I tried to return them, but the  Amazon vendor will not allow me to return the defective product. NOT RECOMMENDED!Over the many years that I have been a happy Amazon customer, I have never had an issue with returns... until now! How can you know if a battery is OK if you only are allowed 2 or 3 weeks? Especially in a solar light, which these batteries are designed for!Poor product and poor return policy (30 days)! I gave this 2 stars because 1 of the batteries is working... so far.UPDATE!!! I have downgraded this review from 2 stars to 1. It is now one month later and the second battery has died.I am now using Ultralast UL14430SL-2P batteries from Radio Shack... They seem to work great so far!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>ordered 6 boxes....received 4 of the same kind and 2 of a different kind.  all were made the same but the 2 different boxes were lighter in color than the other four....will be using them this coming weekend....I assembled them already now we'll just have to see how the cupcakes sit on them</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Well again FP got me to buy another play-set. And once again the set was really cool. My nephew was all over this one. Big enough to get out but not to big that it take us the whole floor. Pieces are well built and just like the other FP playsets there are missiles that will get lost. 2 figures that are cool looking and fit the set just right. Another good product in this line of toys from FP.Pros: super simple to play with for a 3 yr old or older. Not going to lieCons: Dang missiles will get lost.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I have had two of these and both eventually stopped working. The rice cooker is supposed to go from cooking to just warming based on the weight of the rice and water. The water evaporates and the cooker knows to switch to warming. Unfortunately, the first and second time I bought this the sensor was off and the cooker eventually just staid on warm. Cheap garbage!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Bought this to keep my Rightline Gear 100S50 Sport Jr. Car Top Carrier from sliding around on my roof. Worked like a charm.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My son really loved the movie and at first didn't like the purple minions but once he got this thing he loves them (maybe not a good thing!) - all kidding aside, good quality, my kid is pretty rough with his stuff and it stays together with no problems.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This pan is light weight, cleans easily, and has great heat transfer. The size can accommodate family meals as well as single servings. Wish I had one decades ago!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>The size said 5.26 X 5.25 inches. The Calendar I received was about 2.5 x 2.5 inches!! About the size of a Post-it note pad. I hate it when the product is misrepresented!!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I am having the same problems with my Kuvings juicer that other have reported, alot of foam, pulp and jamming.  I replaced an Omega that I loved thinking I would get a better machine.  It is so bad that I have to strain it before I drink and even then it isn't smooth.  I bought mine from Williams Sonoma, an authorized dealer.  I am not new to juicing and have followed the steps exactly as directed to no avail.  I give this juicer a big thumbs down and wish I would have known the quality of the product before I spent so much money.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Poor printing quality. Both drums prints dark on the right and light on the left. You get what you paid for but it works.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This pure boysenberry syrup is just right-not too sweet and not too fruity. Bought two bottles and they were packaged to perfection.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>3M Command products have been a revolutionary solution for vertically hanging items on walls without the need for a hammer and nail. One just needs to be mindful of the item being hung and the wall's characteristics.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I chose this product specifically because it claims to remove latex paint from surfaces that shouldn't have paint on them.  We moved into Navy base housing in July, and there were little smears of white latex paint on the brown linoleum floors from the painters, plus green and red and blue nail polish from the previous tenants.  Added to the mix are globs of pine sap, which are blackish and sticky.  I managed to remove most of these marks with scrubbing, but there were a few stubborn marks that just would not come off the floor.  I used the Krud Kutter at full strength, and with just a little use of the scrub brush, the marks are gone-even out of the texture of the floor.I haven't used it for any other cleaning tasks, but I am satisfied since it did the job for which I chose it.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Very distorted lenses. I wouldn't really recommend them if you need to see through them. I guess that is what you get when you buy a huge package of sunglasses for 7 bucks</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>My eight-year old son loves the taste which makes it easier to get him to remember to take it everyday.  (He never &#34;remembered&#34; to take his Flintstones.  I am guessing that is because he did not like the taste.)  The only issue that I have with this vitamin is that they break easily, therefore, some of them are in pieces.  Otherwise, it is a good vitamin and I will order again.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>... which helps keep down the dreaded 'inward sucking action' while showering.  I like the semi-privacy and light allowing functionality of having the clear top and shaded bottom too.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>No complain at all. My son loves it. He feels more comfortable comparing with another strap together with sax we rent before.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We love this product for its flavor, health benefits, and its availability. I wish it were available here locally in the Richmond, Virginia area. Makes me want to possibly open a Variety Tea store. Thanks. Will continue to buy.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Absolute garbage. Some of the bandages don't stick and others stick so much that your skin literally gets pulled off. I don't know what formula they are using to create the adhesives but this new formula is not better than the ones my pediatrician used back in the late 90s. And the other reviewers were also right about how disordered it is on the inside of the box. Would never purchase again, Amazon please remove this from your catalog and offer us some quality things which you are known for.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This works great for sore muscles and joints! It's very helpful in easing aches and pains from running and cycling.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Good price.... I thought they would be 12 different pirate designs.  It turns out that there are repeat designs.  But they are cute and my daughter likes them.  And for the price.... when the first couple I gave her get moldy - which happens with all bath toys... I'll just take a couple fresh ones out of the drawer and use those instead.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I had issues with my coverstitch skipping stitches. once I received these things worked better. my advice is use the correct needles for your machines!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Needed to replace my Pioneer PLA-25 turntable from 1972 to play my vinyl.This turntable works very well for low price and a lot of plastic. It isfully auto with a dampened dust cover and a metal turntable with rubber mat. Be forewarned that RC wires to A/V are short and you may need to have to add extensions. The preamp cannot be turned off either. It soundsgreat and I should be able to replace the needle for under 10 dollars.Has a speed adjust but have not had to use it. Very happy with it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>If you only buy one toy for your cat(s) this should be it. Mimics a real bird flying and my senior cats finally have a reason to get off the bed!  Great  toy!!!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>these were a great purchase to get my grandson to take that little bit of fiber he needs.  He loves these and that is a great thing! thank you</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I've been very happy with this cooler over two summers of use as a car-camping refrigerator. It holds ice really well. Opening it infrequently (at meal/snack times) and storing in the shade, it kept everything cool and still had chunks of ice after 4 days in 80+ degree weather. I originally wanted a Yeti but decided the price was too much and found this one after a lot of research. You get a lot of performance for the price with this cooler. I like the stainless parts and the spring that holds the lid open is very useful.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>The weight of the camera makes for wobbly videos since it moves the helmet around on bumpy trails. You can try to tighten the helmet to your head but you will cut off your circulation before making it work 100%</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Nice cover. Fits well. Great soft material.The stitching where the corners (rear) meet is not done properly.Small hole showing on both sides. Rather than send back I just restitched myself.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love this stuff.  The waterproof part is where the majic is.  I've used this outside quite a bit now. I even have used it like a protective coating on the ends of my fence boards and it doesnt wash away</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Great price.  From Sony they are 100.  Lasts about a year.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is the best ever. No more cutting fish oil capsules and getting squirted in the face. Purchased this for our 2 boxers, just hit the pump a couple of times in each bowl and they get their fish oil suppliment with no mess. The container is aluminum which is a plus as there is no plastic contamination.  Will purchase this item again for sure.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I believe this is the only 256gb flash drive that is a 'Slider' i.e., capless drive.The speed is around what benchmarks promise, around 110 MB/S Sequential Read and 30 MB/S Sequential Write.Sequential Read :  115.810 MB/sSequential Write :  27.733 MB/sRandom Read 512KB :  106.962 MB/sRandom Write 512KB :  18.882 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) :  6.482 MB/s [  1582.6 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  0.637 MB/s [  155.4 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  7.891 MB/s [  1926.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  1.269 MB/s [  309.8 IOPS]Test : 100 MB [F: 0.0% (0.1/230.5 GB)] (x5)At these speeds, this is no match for the Voyager GS or the Patriot Magnum especially when it comes to writing, but as Flash Drives are, I probably won't be doing extreme writing on it anyway. I also ran h2testw_1.4 on it and found no errors.The pros to this drive are...- Definitely being capless... I've owned many USB's over the years, and I've lost quite a lot of caps so.- Over 50 dollars cheaper than the top performing flash drives(a bit more expensive than Winten I believe, but Winten had horrible reviews so I chose to go with this)So, I think this could be a reasonable solution if you are good at losing caps like me, and  you don't add data to your flash drives very often.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Used this and like it . Did what it said I. The label ,yes would recommend it . I would purchase it again</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I learned the hard-way that there are two types of Chinese Lanterns: a) high quality with charcoal flame and b) these low quality lanterns with a wax block.  The wax block was extremely hard to light.  One of the blocks melted off the flimsy wire set-up and fell to the ground at my feet.  I have the burn scars as a reminder.  In the future, I will find other ways to carry away my birthday wishes.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The case is good quality for the money, however it's a ( tight fit) literally, its made more for a soprano ukulele not a concert.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>If you cannot get enough of Jane Austen, this is a wonderful treat!  The PBS series is literally hours and hours of drama and laughter.  In a Jane Austen movie there a lot of detail from the books that is left out,  which is understandable since you can only fit so much in a two  hours.  However, in this collection you have literally days and days of Jane Austen humor, drama and wisdom.  The ins and outs of the Austin characters are so vivid and surprising in each of the shows.  My husband even got caught up in the them! You'll love it!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Im a member with LEF, and will be until they change their methods. I tried this product ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I replaced with their adrenal formula, much better for me</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>i dont know how to take the mag off ik its stupid of me but i cant c a handle</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I bought these to use for my tub and they came stuck together and the peel and stick did not peel off</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The sheathe is plastic and feels cheap, but the ax has a nice feel to it.  It needs a little sharpening out of the box.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Good protection. Has pockets for kids books or toys to keep them distracted in the car. Stays securely in place.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Hope its doing its job.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I bought these because the standard issue iPod earbuds would start falling out of my ears every two steps while walking...PRO: They stay in. At the gym, walking, etc. Also: Unlike Sony (and other) in-ear buds, the cord lengths for both sides were equal. (Sony's had a short one side so that you can supposedly put the cord behind your head, which is incredibly awkward & does NOT work for everyone).CON: Although the bass was more consistent with the Griffin earbuds (because they were actually staying in my ears), the painful high frequencies (treble) were nearly unbearable. The only way to tame these was to change EQ on the ipod for \"small speakers\" which sort of flattens the sound out and reduces the treble as much as possible. Still so much treble that I need to turn the volume low to not feel the pain. Sometimes I like my music LOUD. The extra treble just *feels* like ear damage.But here's the worst CON -- When one little grey ear cap fell off my headphone inexplicably somewhere between the gym and home, I realized I now have to throw away a perfectly functioning pair of headphones. I was super-careful to make sure that this detachable part was always there, and keep the earbuds in a case when not in use, so I have NO idea how this happened.In short, a decent price for earbuds that won't last you that long unless you never leave the house with them, but then what's the point of the in-ear feature?</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Good pots for keeping various plants in although they're aren't meant to be decorative. Particularly good for staring small trees, shrubs or vines in. A few of the planters in my bundle were ripped down the side but aside from that my army of trees likes them and will live in them for the winter.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Fast delivery. Great chick flick drama. Even I like it too! Much better than the captured copy someone gave us. This is a first rate quality video. Would order from this seller again!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I decided to buy this meter after reading reviews of several comparable ones. Seems the others have many reports of defective meters. Add this one to the list. The meter gave crazy readings and would not calibrate, which suggests a bad sensor. I guess no one tests such units before sending them out any more. Note: this unit does not come with calibration or storage solutions.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Incredible live music. Layne Staley's vocals are astounding. Music and lyrics are excellent. In my opinion, this was THE band of the 90's.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought three of these and used them this past weekend. These are the best mic holders I've ever used on a stand. Very high quality and the rubber used in the product grips the mic nicely. We use AKG D5 and Shure Beta 87A mics and these clips held both with no problem!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This size last me about a month and the fit is great for my 18 month (running) son. Pampers has really been the only brand that has held up to my busy bee.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These toys look so fragile - but they aren't.  My son drops them and plays rougher than he should sometimes, and they still hold up.  I think the reason he likes them so much is due to how realistic they are.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>what a difference this product makes.  my 5th wheel hardly moves at all,even on windy days. I would recommend this to family and friends.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This is a great cake toper and was supper cute. The only thing was that it is heavy and sunk into our cake.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>thank you sooooooo muchit was realy goood,you have high productI well try again buy from youthank yougood luck</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>There is a reason for the plastic spacers.  I am 6'4&#34; and bench 350 or more now days.  These puppies kept me busy just separating them.about three minutes once two got together without the plastic separator.  You can't JUST push one to the side and it will come loose.  It took all my grip to separate two and after the second messup, I did not want to fight them twice.  WOW, is all I can say!!Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Me being not so smart, smashed my original stone on the floor of my garage.  This is exactly the same and just as great.  I have written a review on the Ultra fine stone, this is a wonderful product. Capable of sharping any steel I have seen(I have 50+ pocket knives) .  Zdp-189 no prob, s30v, even s110v easy.  This is all to a point of course and assuming that you can maintain an even FINAL bevel,(the cutting edge).  Not great for taking off a lot of steel on the harder steels.  I found it difficult to reset the secondary bevel on a CPM-M4 Benchmade, but this is tough stuff. For the final bevel on that same knife though this will put a nasty sharp edge on the finished edge.  Of course this not the final step with this system, and will not get the ultimate result, but as with everything that Syderco makes, it is a wonderful product.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought it for the wardrobe. It is a thick material. I think if there is a zipper will be better.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This device is GREAT! Easy to install, easy to follow directions!  The DVD that came with the product didn't work I emailed to the address on the pamphlet, they responded quickly with a link that was quick to install.  I want to THANK YOU for saving our old cassettes! We are enjoying the whole process!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Wow... who would have thought you could get excited over a comb.  Well, I was wrong as this comb really is worth getting excited over.  Yes, It is pricey,  but I am serious it does make for a better hair day.  It is great for combing your hair when it is wet, it takes the tangles out very gently.  Plus, it really does work wonders for your hair when it is dry and I have even experimented using this comb and then trying another comb and my hair turned out much better with this comb.  It is difficult to explain it, however if you try it you will know what I mean.  Anyhow,  I would have no problem giving this comb highest recommendations and am even thinking of buying a spare as I would be devastated if I ever lost it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Does what it is supposed to do! I'm not a techy person but I had no problems installing the adapter. Once it is set-up you don't have to mess with it which is a huge improvement over the USB dongle U-Verse gave me during their set-up. I have Win 7 Premium Home edition.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>You won't find a better 2 bay 8TB capacity NAS for this price. Have had no issues with mine and it is very easy to install, setup, and access from anywhere. Might not have the fastest transfer speeds out there but works great for its intended purpose. Plus it uses next to no power and the fan will only kick in when it needs to and is controlled by the temperature. This thing is silent except for when the drive spins up when in use. Since part of the outside is aluminum it acts as a giant heatsink and rarely uses the fan.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>So I love the loom, its very easy to use since I am not capable of real knitting or crocheting, and especially since I'm 14 (on my moms account) its not very boring and is easy and entertaining and something to do while watching TV.The looms are moderately sturdy. I used the red one twice and the pegs were fine, no complaints. Then I use the green loom, and all the pegs started coming off when I would hook them over. Very annoying. The pegs will still go back in as I'm knitting, so it didn't ruin my hat but its very annoying to have to keep sticking the pegs back in every two or three rounds. Slightly disappointed that all the looms aren't all the same quality.:(Would recommend just buying the loom set available at Michael's instead.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The Screen that comes with the kit is made from a very solid material, and is pretty efficient at organizing charts and tables that are often referenced but hard to memorize. I have not yet run the adventure yet, but it looks like it has some interesting situations, and ideas in the module. No complaints on what it did include.My only critique would be the lack of text about being a good GM in this particular system. The main book has a lot of information, and a few general pointers that apply no matter the system. I was hoping this kit might have some tips and information on running this particular system more effectively for those not as familiar with it, but who have experience GM'ing.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I thought I was buying a spray bottle but it was actually a refill bottle.  Wife wasn't happy had to then go and buy a spray bottle..  Pain in the butt.  Gave me wrong product.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This is a very neat gadget, we make wonton tacos and it is just perfect for the job and it was inexpensive</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>These earphones are perfect for the price.  I loved my Sony headphones, but didn't want to keep spending $30 for replacements.  The sound isn't much different on this less expensive Panasonic set; you won't be disappointed.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These vitamins are the very best on the market. I take them everyday to keep UTI's at bay.  I've tried others, but none of the other brands seem to work</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Love the case. Very sleek. Slides easily into my pocket. Keep dropping it but the phone is still fine. If grip is an issue, be careful this case is very smooth.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I've loved this movie, and I have the DVD version.  But I recently borrowed the BluRay from Netflix and noticed how grainy the picture is. Nothing especially bad, but it should be better than DVD, but it's not.  I have a 1080p, 48-inch Samsung high-def TV, and my other Blu-ray movies have great picture quality, but this blu-ray version of \"Wolf\" is even more grainy than my DVD.  What gives?  And the lack of any \"Special Features\" makes this Blu-ray pointless.  The transfer to Blu-ray was not well done.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is a great produst and my kids wil have every morning. It fills them up and I love that I order it and it comes right to the house.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>is the best feature on this DVD.  It gives me the flexibility to either complete the DVD in its entirety but in the order that I choose or I can create a 30 minute workout, depending on the time I have available and the areas that I am more interested in targeting.  After the 10 minutes in each segment I at least feel satisfied that the particular area did receive a decent workout.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The device works very well and is convenient to leave on the desk top ready for a drive to be inserted.  I have numerous only IDE drives and need to be able to get to old backup files. The Seagate drives I have worked perfectly, while the one Maxtor drive didn't work at all. The Maxtor drive has a wider jumper pin bay between the power plug and the data cable. So it would not insert into the device.  Fortunately I mainly have Seagate drives so that is not a big issue.  I don't have any SATA drives lying around to try it on so I have no idea how good that is. It is so convenient being able to insert a drive and go, that I have decided to use it to do my system backups to harddrives instead of to tape.  Some reviews say that have had problems getting the system to recognize the drive after inserting.  This has not been a problem for me.  It behaves much the same way as a thumb drive does.  The only difference I have really notices is in the drive letter selection. Unlike a thumb drive the hard drive apparently gets a higher priority in the drive letter selection.  So when it is inserted any thumb drive you have inserted into the same device will get shuffled downward and its letter will be given to the new harddrive.  The Eject option is also not available, like it is for other external media.  But the drive can still be disconnected in the USB taskbar tool just like any other drive, so there is no risk in losing data with incomplete data writes.I recommend this device. I have Windows 7 running on a bottom-end server class system.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I love my mug.  I was a little disappointed that it was so small.  It will hold a regular cup of coffee or other drink.  I wish I had purchased a larger size.  Still I love the mug!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Dad is almost 94 years old and uses them at night only.  He likes the way the fit and the comfort.  Rose Ann</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>did you read the title? i'll repeat BEST DRILL EVER. actually, that goes to the drill and impact, the entire kit is just awesome, i wouldnt trade it off for any other set. i have yet to meet its match within reason. i've recommended this exact combo pack to MANY others and they all love it also. the battery last a long time, its never taken more than 30 minutes to go from a dead battery to fully charged. put up 20 sheets of 4x12 5/8th drywall and never needed the second battery that day even. it ROCKS.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Pros: Very well designed and manufactured~ Good fit and finish~ Sturdy, solid grill~ The infrared is a completely unique cooking technique that works and works well~ The top, front door, grates, burners and infrared emmiters and hardware are all stainless steel~ Seems to use less propane than conventional gas grill~ Temp gauges seem to be accurate and solid~ Allows you to burn woodchips or natural wood charcoal directly on the grates its amazing and soo easy to do!!~ The best grill I have ever owned....or used for that matter!!~ If your in the market for a $300 grill, buy this thing!Cons: Not too sure about the Surefire start system as of yet. The button has to be pushed just right but once it is... click click boom its lit!~ Ikea has nothing on Char-Broil in the \"Uhhh I have to put ALL OF THIS together?\" catagory~ If your not a handy person with a good set of basic tools, you better hope your friend or neighbor is!~ I am a handy person and this was a pretty long build to do by my self(3+ Hours). I don't know if this is really such a con, but for some it may be so i figured I would mention it. One reason it takes so long is because it is a well built grill with a lot of heavy duty hardware and support brackets ~ LOTS OF PARTS TO ASSEMBLE!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Been using this SSD for a few years now as the primary hard drive disk in my Mac Pro tower.  Has worked very well, very fast, real reliable, etc.  I think it was a great choice to have a SSD be the main drive and a high capacity SATA be the secondary for file storage.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is a good gun but i bought a reflex sight for it and it does not fit.Pros:good qualityshoots hardlooks coolaccurateCons:sling hard to adjustcan't add attachmentscan't think of another reason to complainOverall a good gun</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Bought 2 of these. Put 1 in and it is working well. The other one, the gasket is ripped inside the plastic packaging :(. Have to go out and get a gasket to put it in.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This does exactly what it says. No rips or tears, fits great. Great price. I would recommend this to anyone with an apple bluetooth keyboard.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have wired several stereos over the years.  This one was difficult, only because I did not know that a couple of wires had to be swapped on my Chrysler Crossfire.  Other than that, the harness worked well.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The picture for the item doesn't do it the justice it deserves. The toaster is so beautiful and the color is rich and not cheap looking and for someone like me that love features the buttons are a plus. Very happy with my purchase</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Not only is it one of the cheapest peanut butters on amazon, it is one of the best. Everythnig it needs, nothing it doesn't. No separation, not overly sweet or bland.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I bought this battery a few weeks ago.  It is not perfect, but it is better than spending $40 on a new battery.  The charge lasts for 2-3 days, but the problem I have had is that with the new battery, my phone turns itself off if it gets bumped.  This loose connection may or may not be the fault of the battery.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I would recommend this product. Purchased for a young lady with bad acne. I can see the difference it makes. Her skin is clearing slowly and I can see the cleanliness as well.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I bought that watch and like its style, but not happy with second arm which automatically stop every 30 minute and i have to press start button to restart.But when That arm stop working, watch keep its time correct</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>ONE GREAT COMPANY TO DEAL WITH AT FANTASTIC PRICES.  LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF WHAT SOME OF THOSE FAMOUS MARTS AND SHACKS WANT TO CHARGE AND THE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT, IN FACT I TOOK THE FIRST PURCHASE I MADE BACK TO THE SHACK BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT BEGIN TO HOLD UP TO THE QUALITY OF THIS ONE AND I HAD PAID OVER $30.00 PLUS TAX.  THIS COMPANY SHIPS EXTREMLY FAST!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>works better than expected!!!! bought it for my husbands laptop and never have a problem this whole time! worth it!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I read a lot of reviews before buying. People complain the door does not fit the phone very much. I think the factory has fixed this. the battery door i have fits the phone tightly. the battery is also very good.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>If you are athletic, at least relatively flexible and are looking for a supplemental tool, your not going to be screaming this things praise.  Save yourself the money and time and just buy the Back Magic adjustable or better yet, an inversion table, you'll be much happier.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This product is okay - good for when you travel with the laptop.  The only fear I have that those little legs in front will evenutally break because they are plastic.  Plastic does not last that long with constant usage.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The HD on my Mid 2010 15\" MacBook Pro was going out.  I could hear (click, click) the hard drive head flying all over the disk trying to find data.  I was fortunate to get one last Time Machine backup with the help of placing cold compresses above and below my HD to cool it down (old freeze hard drive recovery trick).  I ordered one day service and got it FedEx on a Saturday! YES! Thanks Amazon!  Received in a padded envelope.  Not a big deal since the SSD is light and more shockproof than regular hard drive.  Additionally, the box allows for reasonable cushion as well.  Good that minimal packaging was used.  I hate when packaging is unnecessarily 10 times bigger than the actual product.  Such waste!  From there it was a reformat and restore from Time Machine.  Everything went well and operated like any other HD.My choice to go to SSD was not very deeply researched.  I knew SSD have been around for a while and I knew of the performance and durability it provides.  I know that the ruggedized laptops at work were running SSD.  If those guys are using them in rough conditions then it should be ok.  Since I believe heat was the reason my original drive went, I decided to just go for SSD because of durability reasons.  I knew it was supposed to be faster but didn't know what to expect.  I wasn't paying attention to load times before so I wasn't very impressed initially.  I then used a friend's laptop with similar specs and saw the difference.  The startup and program load up time are definitely shorter.  It just seems like the programs are on the starting line waiting for your click to sprint to the finish line of loading the program.  I did notice the laptop seems to run cooler.  I do photo editing and I did a test to export a set of pictures.  I didn't measure times but I believe time was cut in half.  So far everything is running well!  Some are worried about degraded performance but I think by that time it would be time to get another SSD anyway.  However, I will be mindful of my SSD usage as I say that... haha!I am glad I spent the extra money to get the SSD.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I have tried several different habanero sauces and this comes close to being the perfect red habanero sauce. It has a lot of flavour and as expected is very hot. I use it on my omlette, as dipping for boiled eggs and sometimes in sandwiches. It does not have as much flavour asEl Yucateco Extra Hot Habanero Sauce, 4 oz.. But it is less hot, so will be more tolerable for most people who can't handle the super hotness.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is Definatly their best CD yet.

The box states: \"Read & Write 2 Hard Drives simultaneously.\" It also states: \"Rapid Data Access & Exchange w Single eSATA or USB Cable Connection.\" NOWHERE does it even mention that you should check to see if you have port multiplier capability (which is absolutely necessary to run two drives over one eSATA cable).At this point most systems DON'T have port multipliers. I'm using a relatively new Dell Precision M4400 with the PM45 chipset. It does NOT support port-multiplying.The device works fine, and is only a couple bucks more than the single slot version, but be aware that you likely WON'T be using two drives at once with eSata on this device.Also, the hole in the dust flap that is meant to keep a 2.5\" drive in place is rather annoying, as it fails to prevent dust from collecting inside the device.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought this cable to use with my old HP 5P printer after my old desktop conked out. All of my laptops have no parallel port, and this seemed the quickest and cheapest solution for me. I picked this cable bacause of its silver shielding, it looks flexible.Got the cable, plug it in and wait about a minute for Vista to load the driver. Then the printer appeared in the printer list and that was it. Painless. Really worked, despite of a couple of bad reviews that gave me pause.The only bad thing is there is no manual that comes with the cable and nowhere, enven manufactor's website, that I can find if my printer is compatible. So if you have a HP 5P LaserJet and need this cable, go for it. It worked for me. There is a driver cd that was included in the box, but I don't need it. Guess if I run Windows 98 then I will.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Works great with my computer and was cheaper than buying a new charger for my computer from the store !</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Really good!!

There is one small negative though...I started playing RB again after a 15-year layoff, but liability issues  (and common sense) now require eyewear at every gym. I generally don't like this kind of thing, but I'm willing to to accommodate gym rules in order to play such a crazy great game (should be an olympic sport).My first eyewear was given to me by a friend, and I knew after a five-game series that this would be my first RB purchase (before a better racquet, etc.). The eyewear he gave me fogged and was blurry... I couldn't really even play and wanted to just take the damn things off (but couldn't). It was like playing with blinders.So I read up on RB eyewear and decided on these... it's been nine months of heavy-duty play (we play 90-120 minutes for 5-7 games three times a week... there is no dry material on my body at the end of the matches). These have been awesome... crystal clear focus (I normally wear glasses but not for RB), no fog ever (I sweat heavily), no scratches (I wash them before every series and dry them on whatever I have handy). They have adjustable length earpieces and a hearty closed-cell foam band across the entire length of the frame (keeps sweat from running into your eyes).The only negative is that there are cracks in the lens... several small ones that emanate from the nose piece... but they haven't spread and they don't interfere in play at all... I don't see them (they are under 1/8&#34; in length).Bottom line, if I had to buy another pair I would buy these without question. They are great.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I was really excited when I received this and thought that I wouldn't have to worry about my daughters head flopping around while I was driving and she was sleeping. I used it when my dad say in the back with baby and he said that it kept shifting and it didn't hold her head up high enough. Her head would still droop down and flop around whenever I hit a bump. So I stopped using it. Back to the old drawing board of trying to look for the perfect neck support!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Does anyone know if this router is good for xbox live?

I called Fellowes customer service and a nice woman called another office to find out about this, saying she had never had this complaint before. She came back with the explanation that yes, they can smell, and that the boxes were probably stored in a humid area before sale. She suggested setting them outside to dry, if this was possible. So, it's been two days and the things still smell, a little less, but enough to get my very allergic husband with his bad nose to complain about the stench. We did not buy these boxes through Amazon but from a major local office supplies place. They happen to be going out of business. We had already taken the boxes apart and frankly, it's a bother to repackage and take them back. But, boy, never again!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Works perfect in my Blade 350 QX.

When one of my components turned off (and I have one component that turns itself off automatically if not being used), the switch fails and the screen goes dark.  I sent a question to IOGEAR on this, and the solution was to add the power supply.  When one of the connected HDMI lines loses power, I believe that the voltage drops low enough to turn off the switch.  Adding the external power supply fixed the problem.  I am rating it excellent here because the customer service at IOGEAR was awesome!  In a time when customer service has gone downhill in many electronics areas, these guys were helpful, fast, and excellent!  The switch (with added power supply) is exactly what I needed to switch between my BlueRay player and my cable box.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love this frame it is very study.

I find that the system where you pack, then push down the bag to reduce its size results in the sides popping out.  Maybe that'll change.  Regardless, I can fit a lot in this bag and it fits fine in the overhear compartments.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I just purchased this phone to replace a 5 year old Panasonic phone that was outdated.  This new phone is good..except I find the sound/volume not as high as my old Panasonic.  It should definitely allow you to go 2 bars more for talk volume.  The speaker phone volume level is higher than the \"talk\" volume level.  I think I might send it back.  I want to hear the person I am speaking to (they say they hear me fine).  A bit disappointed with the volume level but all else is good.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I needed a portable waterier for my dog in a hurry with the hot weather here and did not take the time to read the reviews on this or I never would of bought it. As many have said, it leaks! Even the hang tag on the bottle says Leak-proof and spill-proof. Unless you are able to keep this in an upright position during non use, I suggest you look for something different. This has a rubber tip with 3 slits, and drips when it is in any other position other than upright. It does have to be popped out of the holder/tray and placed in the proper end to use, which can be a hassle. I replaced the rubber tip with a regular water bottle cap and just use it as a portable water bowl. That way I can throw it in the car or backpack, or dog pack without the leakage problem. The only thing handi about this is the price,  as a water bottle with a corn on the cob plastic tray rubber banded to it does the same thing. One review said the \"Gulpy\" by New Angle isn't sold on amazon, it is now. I recommend buying the Gulpy for a leak proof, hassle free container.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>USED THIS WITH MY LEATHER CONDITIONER AND  CLEANER YESTERDAY.  YOU GET TWO SPONGES.

Since I had open heart surgery and I am on all kinds of blood thinners, I am constantly cold and this heater has been a Godsend! It works several different ways and I usually set the temp at a certain degree and let it function by itself. I use it in my den a it is amazing how fast it maintains the heat in that room. My house faces North and as the sun heats up the back of the house (the furnace thermostat is in the Family room in the back of the house, the front rooms get cooler and this solves the problem. I have tried thermal clothes, heated throws, heating blankets, etc., and this beats all of them for keeping me warm and comfortable. I have the one with the oscillation and it helps the room warm up even faster. It's quiet, it has alot of functions and it does the job.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I love the idea of the fast-lock technology, along with the fair price.

The included software makes it super easy to capture your videos and export them to YouTube, QuickTime or iMovie.Unfortunately, there really isn't much in terms of built-in video editing software and given the reason why most people are buying these devices (i.e. to capture their old VHS movies and preserve them in a digital format), it would be nice if there was something along these lines included. Still, as far as the hardware goes, it's pretty simple to use and pretty effective.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>The Bear Creek mixes are unquestionably 5-star but at more than three times the supermarket price for the same products (NW Suburban Chicago), the prices are tantamount to robbery.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Was of good quality and was perfect for an apartment bath with no towel storage. very pleased with heavy duty materials</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>good for what your going to pay for it,covienent size,adaquate,going to try camera adaptor with it,forget the tripod that comes with it.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>STATIC. These usb adapter tend to give static out of nowhere whenever your listening to music. I think the issue might be flash related, but I'm not 100% sure. If it wasnt for this issue I would give it four stars, because it functions and gives out decent sound. But frankly this is really ANNOYING. I don't use any other browser but Firefox, and i'm tired of listening to music through my laptop and out of nowhere a huge static sound (similar to the sound of the static you hear when your tv has no tv station on).If you have the money to replace the soundcard in your laptop/desktop then do it, because this cheap,simple fix is not worth it. I have not tried any other usb adapters in this price range but I assume they would have their own fault in them, like maybe hissing/poor build quality etc.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I got a lot of looks with these antlers, people loved them.

I was looking for a road but the street sign was torn down -- it was Purgatory Road -- so not an unexpected development, I plugged in the GPS looked at just the map feature and, sure enough it was the little road I had just driven past. The GPS has saved me a lot of time getting from one place to the other because I don't have to backtrack. The only quibble is that it is useless in places like the Pine Barrens, it knows how far something is away but cannot even tell you a direction to start finding your way back out -- very easy to lose your way when all those sand roads start looking alike. I guess you would need a more robust one for something that desolate. But it seems to do a good job for your normal driving. When I went online to download the maps I found that you can have many different vehicles from the Garmin Garage, so I had a Christmas cookie one week, a Christmas tree the next and even downloaded a lawn tractor for summer use. What fun! You can download voices too, but they are kind of stingy in this department I would have liked to have some real choices, you can pay for commercial ones like Darth Vader it if matters that much to you.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>the diapers i received barely hold together. 1.the tape comes apart at the belly 2.once the diaper becomes wet, small gel crystals leak out. i have used pampers swaddlers for over a year and have never had this experience. poor flawed knockoffs!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The Secret that we all need to know...Order one if you have not seen it yet and learn the secret of every success you want.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Works great and at a fraction of the cost of other processors.

Otherwise Christmas Day is spent running around trying to figure out crazy toys like this one. I have had a hard time with toys before, but this one definitely ranks near the top.First I put in batteries and turn the switch to on. Nothing happens. I put in newly charged batteries, nothing happens. I put in brand new duracells, nothing happens. This might sounds straightforward, but putting batteries in this thing is nothing of the sort. I wondered why there was two screws on the battery lid instead of the normal one on most toys. Its because the force required to press and keep the lid down is like trying to close a suitcase that has two times too many clothes in it. Absurd!Finally, like some others here, I hooked it up to the computer thinking maybe it needed to 'activate' or some such nonsense. The thing turned right on!!! At least it wasn't broken, I thought. After transferring some mp3s, I read the instruction manual thinking maybe there was a trick.The instruction manual was completely USELESS. It had a small diagram of the unit and told how to plug in the USB cable and that's it.I unplugged from the computer and turned the unit on. Nothing. I thought maybe it takes a while to boot up. So I waited a bit. Nothing. Out of frustration I hit the play button thinking that might be the key, voila!! It turned on!!!That's right, on a toy so simply made you could potentially give it to your 2 year old, they make the prerequisite for playing songs, the holding down of the green button after the switch is turned on. So what looks deceptively like the perfect toddler toy is actually a monster of complexity in disguise with a feature that completely kills the ease of use otherwise. However, even 2 year olds are pretty smart with electronics, I'm sure she'll figure it out.Another tip, but if you press and hold the green button while the unit is on, it will shutdown. That's right, press the Green ON button to shutdown!!!I'm reluctant to give this more than two stars because its extremely unlikely that more than 20% of the people who buy this thing will figure out all of the above. I feel sorry for the folks who think the only way to turn this thing on is to plug it into the computer. However, I'm going to go with three, because once I figured all of this out, I know my 2 year old is going to love it, and it will make my wife happy that she's not putting CDs in her boombox and playing music that way anymore.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Bought this for my fiance who loves old school Twista - really old school Hip Hop in general.

It all started out normal mixing up the bleach then applying it to my hair and I waited my normal amount of time. Then I hopped into the shower to wash it out and as I started to scrub CHUNKS started to fall into the tub, my long beautiful hair being swept down the drain!!! I got out and looked at my head and noticed that my hard literally MELTED off where I had applied that stuff (mostly on my part line) and what was left of the hair o n my head that had been sprayed lost ALL off its elasticity (the hair underneath was still healthy FYI)! I screamed or my fiance who, thank god, is so positive and understanding, and we started cutting off the hairs that were crispy and figuring out how to fix this. I still had hair left on my other side so I could pretty much do a comb over to conceal this catastrophe. But TRUST me it has been 6 months, an extremely short bob hair cut and lots of trims and my hair in places still feels crispy! I can not believe that John Frieda doesn't state a warning on the bottle do not use if you bleach you hair :( I wrote this so noo girl or women has there hair melt off like mine did!

Unfortunately, the prong is so large and rounded that it won't go through the belt holes.  It would have been nice to be able to see the back of the buckle prior to purchase so that I could tell it would not work with my belt.  The company sent it very promptly and it does look like the picture.  I believe it is only for a man's belt though.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Gave 2 away since you only need a little it will last and friends liked it so I gave them a bottle.

It is true, as one reviewer wrote, that these are musical instruments, not junky toys - the sound is way better than you would expect at this price.  I also like that they are translucent so you can see and explain the 'works'. The kids absolutely love them! Maybe my 7-year-old granddaughter is precocious, but she was picking out 'Jingle Bells' within a few minutes. I also bought one for each parent. Sure beats watching tv!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Based on the theatrical previews, I was expecting more of a crop circle drama. Instead, I received something better. This is a great, thought-provoking movie. It is not for the weak-minded or the viewer just out for a fun flick to watch. Entertainment is great, but sometimes it is nice to have a challenge or two such as Signs. This movie questions the existence and relationship with a 'higher power' without being new-agie or overtly religious-specific. Gibson and the rest of the cast did a wonderful job of mystery, fear, faith, humor, and just plain acting. The director should be proud of doing such a good job with his limited film budget, awesome artistic cinematography, and production of Signs.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>once again great product..but pricey.

But really, there is nothing to improve, it's just a great, powerful coffee grinder. Same good quality as my old one was.

The micro-size USB receiver  is almost flush with my laptop, and does not protrude past the charging cord.  The optical tracking is much better than any other wireless mouse I've had.  There is one problem with the design: if you have a tendency to drop stuff, you end up scurrying to catch the skin and the mouse. Which I  have done. Alot.  My dog loves it when I drop it. He goes chasing it as if it were a real mouse. They could have put a more substantial lip so the cover doesn't come off so easily. My dog wouldn't be too happy, though.  Other than that, it's a keeper.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I've been using this TV solely for videogames and it works great.

The color was nice, size was perfect but when we first used it and cut food on it the plates showed the cuts on the plate.  I had never seen that before on any other plastic plates I used by other makers.  Im glad it is microwaveable but I do not like all the knife cuts on the plates. For the price of these plates should they really show these cuts on it?</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The product I received was a brand new, OEM, Genuine BMW part that matched perfectly.The shipping was timely and I couldn't be happier.Those who are saying it isn't genuine BMW because the silver parts are \"raised\" are wrong. If you were to walk up to a BMW parts counter they would hand you the same one I received here. Great product, I'd recommend anyone buy this! Just make sure it fits your model and you're good to go.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I've been using the Oral B electric toothbrushes for years with the little rotating head.This new version came out and my last dental checkup couldn't have gone better.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Used this steam mop for the first time yesterday.  Was very pleased with the results on our large-tiled kitchen floor.  Swept first,  then used the steam mop.  I chose the steamer mop pad, and poured a small amount of the cleaning fluid that came with machine, I filled balance of the solution canister as per instructions (warm -- not hot-- tap water. I did not take notice of the time, but it could not have been more than about 25 minutes to steam/clean our large kitchen/hallway areas.  Solution provided by Hoover smells nice and, along with using the steam, did a great job. I will research where I can purchase the solution for less, or just use something else.  Can also use just vinegar solution (advice given by installer of the stone floor in our kitchen).  With vinegar solution, I would choose to have machine do continuous steam cycle.Where extra steam was needed, I pressed the steam lever (lever was comfortable to use, did not cause pain in my arthritic thumb).I had researched several steam moppers, and had considered the Haan, but I am glad that I saw the Hoover and its reviews.  I am happy with my purchase, and the fact that the pads are priced fairly.It was easy to wash the used pad, and I did it by hand, squeezed well, then line dried in my laundry room.Con:  The 2 canisters were a bit difficult for me to take off the steamer, but I have arthritic hands.  I was able to do it by stepping on mop base, leaning the stick against me, then grasping the canister with both hands.  If you do not issues with your hands, you should not experience difficulty.Overall, I am glad that I made this purchase.  Having owned a Shark which always left my floors not as clean as I wanted, this choice is wins hands-down.  The Shark \"died\" several weeks ago and was put in our town's bulk pick-up.  Our local Home-Depot had a ridiculously low price on this model, and S/H was free, however I chose to have the item shipped to the store where I was able to pick it up.  I did this because we desperately needed to clean our floors after having hurricane Sandy.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I tried the dermelect smooth upper lip anti-aging treatment as directed twice a day. Maybe because I am 75 years old I could not detect any improvement. In the contrary, the area above my lips has become very sensitive, I often get red spots. After 4 weeks of faithfully using this product I have decided to give up on it. If Amazon were Macy's I would ask for my money back. It might help younger women, but for me it was a wast of time and assured me again that all these promises that cosmetic manufacturers make are unfounded.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We bought this for our sons bed because he is still in pull ups and sometimes they leak. This has completely protected the mattress several times. Very simple to wash and dries quickly. We have a shallow mattress, so it is a bit baggy on the sides, but this would be great for a deeper mattress.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Works perfectly for our plants.  Nice, light, and small.  Long spout gets into the spider plants and allows us to apply water to the soil.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>White and black are the worst colors for me to find things. A white phone laying on a table with papers might as well be invisible. My wife got an otter case that is bright green. That works so much better. This case fits well, and I don't know what else I'd want in a case. It haven't dropped it, but it feels sturdy.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I like that it is not bulky and it is not amazing but its functional. Like the color and works for what it is needed.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>This product is okay I find that it is a little to large for my application needs and find that they fall off or start to peal rather quickly where as the ones that I paid a little bit more money tend to stay on for months rather then weeks.  I have cut then down to the size of just the screen and then use a skin to go around the outer edges and this seems to hold them down a bit better then just using the protecter themselves.  I do like how they come with a wipe to clean the screen before applying however I would recommend that you clean the screen with alcohol instead!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>the sauce I heard is great , but the company who is selling it , is the worst company ever, after waiting about a month , they refund my mony back , so ugly behavoir , its not about money its about how you treat your customers and leave a good impression.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>like the looks and composition.  a little pricy tho.  it was listed a few weeks before on amazon for some $10 plus less.  it does the trick however and we are generally happy.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I really like these bars and look forward to eating them.

If you have a &#34;sweet&#34; craving, this will satisfy it nicely with natural sweetness: no sugar is added. This is a major plus!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>My own fault.  I relied on internet swatches.  This color is almost identical to Nicki Minaj &#34;Fly&#34;.  If you have that already you don't really need this.  However, if you don't have it already, this is a great shade!  This is slightly lighter than the Nicki one but it really is so similar I don't see anyone needing both!  Oh, well.  Great OPI cream formula.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Inexpensive, but solid. Worked right out of the box.That's everything you need to know, but the review says it needs more words to be acceptable, so I added this sentence.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This truck is AWESOME, and I very badly want to give it five stars.  Why not? Because this truck has a very vulnerable Achilles Tendon that kills the fun.First, the good:  This truck is a very solid performer, easily able to stand against Traxxas's 4WD Stampede.  This truck is actually more user friendly than the 'pede thanks to it's AVC feature.  Turning this feature up stabilizes the truck, at the cost of slight performance reduction.  To share a personal experience about it, I drive this truck with the AVC turned off for maximum performance.  My sister's boyfriend came and watched me drive it.  He had never driven a hobby grade RC, and was very timid when I handed him the transmitter.  He felt the truck was too much for him, so I turned on the AVC.  With the AVC, he quickly gained confidence and had a blast driving it.Now....that Achilles tendon.......is the four drive shafts from the differentials to the wheels.  Vaterra decided to forego traditional dogbone style shafts, and went with telescoping drive shafts.  Plastic drive shafts.  Brittle plastic drive shafts that break easily, even when puttering around on flat ground.  Horizon Hobby has been wonderful about replacing them for me, but I don't like working on the truck every time or every other time I drive it!  A CVD system for this truck is in the works, and I fervently hope that this rectifies this issue.So..... I will happily recommend this truck IF you don't mind constantly replacing driveshafts while you wait for the CVD replacement system to be released,  as this truck truly is a blast to drive for botn beginners and experienced drivers.  If you don't want to deal with the drive shafts, then I suggest watching and waiting for improvements to be made to the drive train.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My daughter is 5 months and loves her Sophie.

Seems to fit all the compact Bushnell Trophy cameras. Mine is model 119537C. Does help provide more protection and security for the camera and peace of mind for the owner.

This PPV itself was okay.Basham Brothers & Shaniqua vs. Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty for the WWE Tag Titles.  Was an interseting opener that could have been better and strated the end of the Bashams until they joined JBL's cabinet 8 months later.  Rikishi & Scotty retain the titles when Rikishi hit the Banzai Drop on Shaniqua. (5.5/10)Jaime Noble vs. Nidia in a Blindfold Match.  This match was stupiud and Nidia should have had omebody represent her instead have her face Noble.  Noble cheats to win and don't watch this match. (4.5/10)APA vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team was basically as good as the Tag Title match because this match had the World's Greatest tag Team who are young and are very talented and win this match. (5.5/10)Hardcore Holly vs. Rhyno was the best match of the night so far.  It should have been a Hardcore match Vince what are you thinking?  Holly wins and it still should have been Hardcore. (7/10)Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero for the Cruiserweight Title.  This match is not as good as people say it is and it is a screwjob because Chavo Sr. helps Chavo win the Cruiserweight Title. (7.5/10)John Cena vs. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show for a WWE Title shot at WrestleMania XX.  This was a great match and it is only good for about one month if you keep up with things that change the WWE but if you like wrestling this is the match for you and Angle wins it. (8.5/10)Brock Lesnar vs. Eddie Guerrero for the WWE Title.  Most definitly a Match of the Year canidate when Eddie climbs the top of the mountain to win the WWE Title.  Goldberg helps him win when Goldberg spears Lesnar followed by a Eddie Frog Splash. (9/10)This PPV is way better then the Royal Rumble and this has a match of the year canidate and some other great matches that change the WWE forever.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I use it more than I expected to, and it works great. It's light and has never given me any problems. The cap fits perfectly. This is a very convenient way to transfer files; it simply plugs in. Compare that to the other options of using a cable to another device. I'm very happy with this.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It took me awhile and the use of some other manual coffee products to really appreciate the Hario.  After using the Melitta cone and Clever Coffee Dripper for awhile (which are also great products), I decided to give the Hario cone another try as I wanted to get away from using plastic cones.  The Hario happens to sit perfectly on the small four cup carafe that I use. The advantages of the Hario are the porcelain construction helps to keep the coffee hotter longer, and this cone just brews a superior cup of coffee.  I can make two cups as we do not like real strong coffee (I use one level Hario scoop per 12 oz. of water - which seems to be about half the coffee others recommend); therefore, the Size 02 just holds my two scoops of coffee and after a 30 second blooming period, I stir the grounds then use the slow circular pour method with a glass Pyrex measuring cup being careful not to pour above the top of the grounds (water at 198-200 degrees).  As I have to refill the Pyrex once with a second 12 ozs. of water, it helps to keep everything nice and hot (I also cover the top of the cone and Pyrex with plastic lids to preserve heat); stir once again during the last fill. The result is two perfect mugs of coffee every time.  I haven't timed the process, but I think it takes about 5 to 6 minutes from start to finish.  I highly recommend the Hario if you want a superior cup of coffee!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>This is not the same as Ativa Dandelion tea.

I own 2 Miele's ($700 ea), a Black and Decker cordless hand vac which is the best hand vac on the market I think, and bought the rocket for ease of carrying and touch ups.  I'm surprised by the versatility, ease of use, and also with the pet hair attachment, how well it cleans furniture of pet hair.  It's not overly loud and has a few really nice features, like stopping the brush head if it gets tangled so it doesn't ruin your rug.  Easy to clean, filters just rinse out when dirty, dirt cup easy to dump.  I'm always surprised at how much dirt is in the cup after vacuuming, when I actually thought something was clean.  I don't think it has the suction power of a Miele, but I find I'm using it more and more because it's so nice and light.  Good quality product.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>After years of trying out stockpots and other cooking utensils, which wore out or just plain didn't do the job, I finally decided to buy this one.

One is a tennis player and one is a pretty creepy guy with \"big ideas\" (read: the enemy), they hit it off pretty well, but the second man turns out to get too involved with his ideas and ends up killing the tennis player's wife for him after the tennis player nonchalantly mentions he wouldn't mind having her out of the way.  Now it's a rush to see what the tennis player will do now that he's a suspect and the other man keeps appearing to urge him to kill the stalker's father, via an agreement he didn't make.So it's basically all of Hitchcock's usual fare...  a man on the run, wrongly accused; a man blackmailing him; bumbling cops; a woman who wants to figure it out but doesn't know who to trust initially before fully trusting the protagonist; and old ladies who giggle over discussions of murder.This time I don't buy it, though.  The whole lighter thing comes off as a real gimmick to me (even when the stalker guy drops it in the grate... after the initial suspense, it doesn't matter anyway 'cause he's waiting for dusk.)  I couldn't believe that there isn't some way the protagonist couldn't have gone to the police and proven that he wasn't guilty, if anything because of the two characters they were.  The drunken professor was a useless side-note.  This movie is all of Hitchcock's stuff, but none of his experimentation which is really the stuff I like.In all, this is the most suspensful of his movies, but I can't gather up the energy to care for it.  Once again, I have an issue with the characters.  I'm just so used to Hitchcock telling me the same story over and over again that frankly I'm beginning to feel like he's repeating himself.  The guy had a few recurring themes, sure, but this is starting to fall into merely obsessive pondering of the many different ways to present the same internal fear Hitchcock has of being wrongfully imprisoned.  And with each movie of his I see, instead of said fear making me feel like I'm seeing some auteur at work, I'm beginning to see a guy who needs to relax a little.  I like his much more experimental stuff, where he plays with camera and imagery and narrative and design.  This \"suspense thriller\" stuff with the typical motifs is getting very dull, which is a terrible thing.--PolarisDiB</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I'm a side sleeper so I like my pillows more firm.

I don't use this brush to simply brush my dog, I use it when i give her a bath and my dog LOVES it! The brush really does an excellent job of removing ALL the loose hair, and my dog really loves how it feels as the 'nubs' on the brush massage her skin. I have a great dane mix so it takes a while to bathe her, but she doesn't mind because she loves how good this brush makes her feel. She leans into the brush as i scrub her in circles and back and forth. Last time i washed her she didn't even need brushed after her bath- she had no loose hair left- the Kong ZoomGroom removed it all in the bath! And, it's ergonomically shaped so I'm able to get a great grip on the brush.This is the second ZoomGroom i have purchased, as my ex-husband took the first one when he moved out. It's a must have for my dog's bath.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I thought this was regular brief/shorts with a picture on the back, but (no pun intended)it's like a plastic rear end attached on the shorts.

One pack at $2, plus about $5 for shipping, vs 3 packs for $10 and no shipping. So that part makes sense. As for the product? Exactly as advertised. Foil wrapped swabs, isopropyl alcohol. Easy to open, work well. If you need to clean you or other things with alcohol, these work very well.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Several years ago my boyfriend purchased aCuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Maker.  I was so impressed with it that I immediately went out and bought two of them.  I wound up giving the extra one I purchased to a friend who also loves it. Therefore, when this T-fal came up for review, I wanted to see how it compared to my Cuisinart.After using this machine a couple of times, I would have rated this T-fal 3-1/2 to 4 stars had I not already owned the Cuisinart.  However, because I am use to such an exceptional ice cream maker, I find this one just okay, so that is why it gets a plain three star-rating from me.PROS- It makes one quart of good ice cream (my Cuisinart makes two quarts)- I made both the strawberry ice cream and the lemon sorbet. The ice cream was good. The lemon sorbet came out excellent; although I was surprised the recipe did not call for heating the egg white.  (My Cuisinart recipe uses water instead of egg white.)- I consider the currently listed price of $34.99 reasonable and it's less than half the price of the Cuisinart I purchased.- This machine is quieter than my Cuisinart.CONS- The ice cream recipes are not exceptional.  Although my strawberry ice cream came out good, it was not as creamy or sweet as the recipe that came with my Cuisinart and it tasted icy or more like sorbet. The recipes that came with my Cuisinart are outstanding and a bit more flavorful and probably more calories too.  For instance, the T-fal strawberry ice cream recipe calls for strawberries, powdered sugar, lemon, and heavy cream.  My Cuisinart recipe also includes adding whole milk and vanilla extract and it uses regular sugar instead of powdered and calls for about  more sugar than the T-fal recipe. I did not mark it down for this because this has nothing to do with the ice cream maker itself and recipe books can always be purchased.- The chute on the cover is a little too small so it is not as easy to pour in the ingredients without messing up the top.- Assembling and disassembling the unit is \"sticky\" and tricky.  I had trouble removing the freezer bowl from the base because there is no grip when pulling straight up.  Even lining up the top and locking that in place was cumbersome; although after several tries I have that down well.  The paddle also requires a good push to get it into the motor but now seats easily.- The instructions for cleaning are not adequate.  There are actually 6 parts to this ice cream maker (as opposed to the 5 parts shown in the instructions).  My Cuisinart only has 4 parts.  In order to clean everything but the motor, I had to dissemble all parts. Getting the bowl out of the base is the most difficult.  However, I had to dissemble the lid after making ice cream because the ice cream got stuck in the crevices of the top.  I did not have to do this after the sorbet.  The lid coms apart easily as long as I flexed it when I pulled it away from the nubs holding it in place.- In my opinion, the bowl takes up an odd amount of space in my freezer compared to my Cuisinart. My Cuisinart 2-QT bowl is totally cylindrical and measures 7-3/4 inches wide by 6-3/4 inches tall.  This T-fal 1-QT bowl is flared at the top and measures 5-1/2 inches wide at the very bottom to about 9-1/2 wide at the top due to the handles.  It also measures 6-1/2 inches tall.No matter what machine one chooses, making ice cream is messy and requires prior preparation because of the cooking instructions and the fact that time is needed in the freezer for the ice cream to harden. Also making ice cream usually costs more than buying the pre-made product. The joy I get from making my own home-made product, however, far outweighs these caveats.In summary, although I cannot attest to the longevity of this machine, I think this is a decent ice cream maker for making small quantities of ice cream.  Had I not owned a Cuisinart, I would have been more pleased with this machine.  However, the cumbersome assembly and disassembly is the main reason it is a three star machine to me.PS For those who are interested, I pasted a link to my Cuisinart review in the comments section of this evaluation.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is a darling salt and pepper shaker set that we bought to go with our Halloween tablecloth.

All one needs do is listen to \"Jesus of Suburbia\" on more than one occasion (and preferably in a variety of moods and / or under the influence of this, that or the other thing) to acknowledge the aforementioned assertion as a mere statement of fact..and yeah, when speaking strictly of Billie Joe and Co., here one needs not refrain from employing the adjective \"mature\" both liberally and of necessity.

I used to be a tent guy for all seasons, but have since realized the joys of ultralight hiking (under 20 lb loaded pack for a long weekend; food and water included). BTW: Hammocks are very comfy once you get the diagonal sleeping thing down.I recently bought another from Amazon for my wife. This one did not come with tree straps, not a big deal when Amazon was nearly giving them away. They set up in less than a minute and take down in less than 30 seconds. I've tried others. In fact my son has an ENO (a bit heavier and more$$) and a friend of mine has a Clark (a lot heavier and big$$$). Though I don't think there's anything quite like a Clark, and the ENO is nice as well, the Grand Trunk is a great hammock and has served it's purpose on many hikes and is still going strong.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>this product is a good privacy screen if it was meant for privacy 4-5 ft away.

When travelling, I have placed it atop the stack of phonebooks one finds in their hotel room. If not then be prepared to lean in a little. For the price I'd say it does its job and the manufacture chose quality materials putting this together. Aside from the inclusion of a protective case with this purchase, the next thing I'd improve would be the height it unfolds out to. Otherwise, if you don't mind angling the mirror up it works fine as is.This also works well with their 10x tabletop mirror.

I've sloughed off huge sections of callouses from the balls of my feet and had good and healthy skin there three days later by wearing the bandages during the day, soaking in epsom salt at night after bandage removal and airing my feet out while I sleep.

Even the late Fred 'Rerun' Berry, was not seen in every episode, thus Danielle 'Dee' Spencer and Haywood 'DeWayne' Nelson were featured more prominently, and guest stars such as the Doobie Brothers and Greg Morris (Mission Impossible / Vegas) appeared.

I also took some close up photos of my families decending and they were playful fun photos but up close with all their dive gear on.  I duplicated them and mailed them off.  If you don't have a the money to invest in a professional underwater camera and only vacation dive, I highly recommend this camera for the job.  If you are deep and the camera won't wind, just accend a little and the underwater pressure will lessen then take your photos.

There appears to be a crack on the joint so now when the hose is turned on, a significant amount of water spurts out of this crack which is annoying to say the least!

This one definitely attracts ants as opposed to other brands that just don't have any effect on them. It helped me figure out where is the colony because of ant trail. Before putting it out I had no idea what is the source. Luckily ants were coming from under the baseboard in bathroom behind toilet bowl. I put these just in front of the ant hole. Ant stormed on them and didn't bother coming any further so no ant was seen in rest of the house as long as we have the baits in front of the colony. It seems to work because ants went crazy on it for 2 days and then disappeared, after 2 days new batch of ants went crazy on them. I kept replacing with new bait stations. It has been going on for 3 weeks and 5/6 generations of ants have been fed on my expense. I am not sure if this killing them or I am having ant farm. I have read mostly positive reviews of this product and am so disappointed that it is not working for us. Ants for sure disappears for 2 days before new one comes. Also, they move very slowly just before disappearing implying they had been effected by poison. So this product is worth trying.Finally, when last batch was wreaking havoc on the bait I generously sprayed windex (glass cleaner) on them and on the nest. It killed them on contact and I made sure that a lot of windex gets seeped into the nest. It has been 4 days since, no more ants so far. I think I will stick with windex until I get another solution. Any advice?Am I attracting ants from different colonies? But source of trail is always the same place, the hole behind bowl. Can there be multiple colonies in the walls or ground but ants are showing up from same hole because I put bait in front of it? To counter that problem I am going to put cinnamon sticks in front of that hole as it has worked for another hole in the house. No ants are seen coming out of bedroom hole that is stucked with cinnamon sticks for 2 months now. On unrelated note, I have killed 5 ants that looked like queens a couple of weeks ago. I was so happy to catch them believing that killing queen is the end of colony but no success on that one.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We purchased the Razor MX500 for our 4 year old son.  He wanted a dirt bike and we didn't want to pay for the gas powered bike until we made sure he could ride and that this was something he would like for longer then a month.  He loved it and has ridden it for over a year and it's still going.  This was a great purchase and less expensive then purchasing it direct from the local retail toy store.  My husband and oldest son who is 16 were even able to ride it.  Fantastic purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Great picture online but was somewhat disappointed when this comforter arrived.  The upper part of the comforter is a SOLID light color (it actually looks like a dirty cream) which emphasizes the unattractive color.  The weight is great for a summer comforter but the fabric is very shiny and just not what I find to be appealing.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Love it, got this for the holidays and the football playoffs as well as movies for the family room.  Works like a champ!  Good overall sound that fills the whole room.  If your looking for a good quality sound bar than look no further, it is a Bose!!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Battery works good and fits my laptop well and has a 4 hour charge on my hp mini 110. The battery does lift the laptop back about 1/2 in off of whatever surface it is sitting on so the keyboard has a permanent incline, which i think is kinda nice.. but that depends on the person.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>If you are looking for a light, easy to use, incredible suction power, easily emptied canister, portable stair and pet cleaner, look no further.  The fact that it has a 5 year warranty is the icing on the cake.  LOVE this vacuum cleaner and I'm a dude, so that tells you something.  We have 2 dogs, one who sheds like a monster, and the amount of hair this cleaner picked up directly after using our old vacuum was insane.  Not to mention we filled a whole canister just from cleaning the couch with the detachable tool.  When I saw the amount of dust leaving most vacuums in the infomercial, I knew that was were our dust problem was coming from.  Now we only dust once a week and the house even smells better.  For a third of the cost of a Dyson, this was a no brainer.  We have had it for a month so as longs as it continues doing whats it's doing, best $250 I've ever spent on a vacuum when we go through one a year.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>While it is nice they are healthier, they have a very odd texture when made as indicated and the taste is not that great. I understand it is hard to make a healthy product taste great but these miss the mark by a long shot. Definitely would not recommend them. I do not want to force myself to eat something I do not enjoy just to make it healthier. I would rather not eat them at all then have to put up with these.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>It's not strong enough to hold purses. I'ts way too light and fragile. Doesnt hold much weight, wasn't much satisfied when it came off the wall after hanging a few purses.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The ad says it holds 20 oz.  It really doesn't, because you can only fill 16 or 17 oz into it.  There just isn't any way to fill it to 20 oz. I really don't like products with false advertisements.  I do like that it is easy to clean and fill, which is better than the Perky Pets feeder.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>These are really good measuring cups.  I've been using mine for several years.  The markings are still intact, but somewhat scratched.  My only complaint is that after years of use, the bottoms of all three cups have cracked and now leak.  Not sure how this happened as we are always very careful with them.UPDATE: I emailed OXO and they replaced all three cups free of charge when I told them they were cracked.  Great customer service!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I didnt use the screws that came with it i used the command hooks which work just as well as screws Ill load a photo of mine to show how awesome it is, i might buy another one because i still have some plush animals on my bed though i do have a lot more room on my bed now lol this hammock is large and holds many animals</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>These are cute. We bought them for my 6 yr old daughter, but I think she's still a little young to use it correctly.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Let me start by saying this thing is VERY HEAVY! This is one adjustable hitch that you can really use. One tip, the hitch is solid steel, there is no hollow tube so certail anti-rattle or locking hitch pins won't work. Another thing to think about is how far down this will hang from your truck. If at it's lowest point it's a 6&#34; drop then you also have to consider  the other ball that's hanging down so now your looking at around 9&#34; hanging down. I never thought that a 2wd 3/4 truck would scrap the hitch on an approach.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This is definitely a sharp one, and if you make it through the first twenty minutes, you will absolutely be pulled in through the last minute. It's intelligent, and it's a thriller -- the kind of thriller that is not blood and guts and unnecessary violence, but rather is intelligent and realistically disturbing.Sarah is a successful, professional, sexy woman on her way to celebrate her tenth anniversary in a cabin by a lake. On the way out of town, however, two street teens let themselves into her car, hold her at gunpoint, and demand that she drives them to wherever she's going. Thus begins a \"vacation\" that will change everything, forever.With an underlying message of \"there are two kinds of people in the world, those who need to be rescued, and those who want to rescue,\" the plot takes many turns that are intelligently connected and have surprising secrets (who knew it would turn into a lesbian story?) that make all three characters both heroes and victims.Show Me is a story about a seemingly happy and perfect yuppy colliding paths with two distraught teenagers left on their own and yearning to get out. What results is a gripping, thrilling, mind game of a movie.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>i'm 23 light skin with black heads and dark spots its been 3weeks useing this soap and i'm loving it my face looks so good all the bad on my face is disappearing you gotta give this a try you will fall in love.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Hearing aids domes arrived before the expected arrival date which was a good thing.

Dyson tends to get top marks in most reviews, but they are a bit out of my price range.  I came across the Shark Navigator and found a good deal on Amazon.  My mom ordered it for me as an early Xmas present.  After one use, it looks like it's the first time my floor has been vacuumed since I moved into my apt.  I was stunned at how much dust was in the canister after a single use.  This thing has serious suction power and I'm extremely satisfied.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Nice set and quick shipping. But it does not have a small enough tool to open the Nintendo WII system. I should have researched what was needed before buying this set. I could see the set being handy though for other electronics, just not for what I needed it for at this time.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Not exactly right.  Even in the straightest position this still has my screen tilting about a 15 degree angle, which is not what I was looking for.  After emailing the company to see if they had any suggestions on how to fix the problem, I did not receive any response.  For that reason alone I will give this one star.  There are plenty of different brands of TV Wall mounts so I don't see any reason to deal with bad customer service.  I previously purchased a Peerless TV Wall mount for my 40\" LCD and it has been perfect.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>My holder arrived in an unusable condition.  The plastic is so cheaply molded and poorly finished that a large scab of excess material prevented it from even being opened.  I had to disassemble the whole thing (tough to do without cracking the plastic), take a Dremel tool to it and grind down about an eighth of an inch of material from the back of the lid to make it where the lid could even open.  The lock mechanism is a little tricky at first, and not well-explained or obvious in operation... you have to pull the knob out toward you before turning, and then it locks in the open position.  To close again you have to shut the lid firmly and give it a slight twist in the \"open\" direction before it will unhitch and lock.Overall though, once I made those modifications and got used to the lock operation, I have to say it serves the purpose... it stores the blades and disks safely and securely.  I would have expected better craftsmanship of a Cuisinart product, though... this was definitely not a polished product.Update:  My mother got a similar Cuisinart food processor and wanted this blade and disc holder, so I got it for her last Christmas, figuring that I could do the same tweaking to it so that it would work fine for her out of the box.  When I got it and checked it out, either they've improved their manufacturing process and quality control, or I just had a really bad one for myself, since the one I got for mom worked fine.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Fits his camelBak bottle perfectly, I am so glad I could just replace the parts instead of having to buy a entire new bottle.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Nothing much to it.

I read other reviews that said they ran a little big. This size works for him. He wears them over training pants, but I think they'd fit over a prefold or fitted cloth diaper as well. They do not make noise and seem to be comfy. He does not complain about them at all. He hasn't wet in one yet. He's pretty much potty trained, but wears these when we leave the house...just in case.I previously used the gerber training pants on my older kids and these are much nicer...thinner and more flexible elastic.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I don't really have any problem with them besides the fact they are smaller than I thought.This has happened to me a few times with different things I've bought...

Within a week his alligator had all it's squeakers punctured. After nine days, he insured the squeakers were ripped out one by one. Finally, eleven days past receiving the beloved alligator, we had to shelve it and order another. This toy is awesome, though one with a short lifespan. Finger's crossed the second one lasts longer.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It really works.  Due to the quick disconnect attachments, I can use it on my SUV or motorcycle without reinstalling the cables.  The unit will automatically test the battery to ensure you can reach full capacity.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I agree with the first reviewer - the first mouse steamed up the inside of the trap before I found it in the morning. Since the reason I go through the trouble of humane traps is to NOT kill them, this is a problem. I drilled holes in the tops for ventilation, but the holes continue to get larger, as those strong little teeth spend the night chipping away at them. Think I'm going to try one of the metal traps. One thing I discovered last night: the Wildlife Mix (corn, sunflower seeds, peanuts) that I put out near the bird feeder is a mouse magnet! After a couple weeks of trying crackers, cheese, peanut butter, etc., with few results, I put out five of these traps last night with Wildlife Mix in them, and this morning I had four mice. Bottom line: these traps are easy to bait and do a good job of catching and holding the mice (only one Mighty Mouse was able to topple its trap on to its side and escape), but some ventilation would have been a good idea.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Super small but still able to read clearly and I like how they are sorted by colors. I'm going to put these in my kids journals in huge front so they have it all year.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I use it for everything in the shower. Face, body, hair. It's got a fresh feeling as its peppermint and as such, kind of mentholated. Love it!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I am a bass head and not an audiophile and this small set up really delivers my bass. I don't know much about sound and what not but these speakers sound great in my opinion. They deliver great bass and that can be adjusted to your liking. I especially love watching movies with them.I got these speakers when they were 125 and I don't regret buying them. I would wholeheartedly recommend these speakers to people looking for a small speaker setup with great sound.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I guess since it is genuine leather I expected a little weight to it but wow it's heavy by itself! As a person always trying to stay in shape and making the best out of every situation I look at it as a way to gain a little muscle while carrying it around. However, I will need to buy a light weight computer case for traveling as this is not the briefcase to take on a trip if you have any desire to be comfortable. Overall though, beautiful and durable.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I just needed a little something to have a water bottle in during my daily walks.  I think it is perfect.  It is easy to put on and snap off, which is important, because if your folded up the stroller with it attached, it could get bent or broken off.  Overall I was worried about the ease of putting it on and taking it off, but my worries were unwarranted.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This is a great toy.  The velcro on the cookies makes it really feel like you are cutting the cookies, and then you can put them all on the tray and put on the frosting.  My 2 year old son really enjoys playing with it.

Totally bogus product.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I was very thrilled to find this Contigo bottle as I had the regular one and loved it, however , though the pocket handy, it is heavy to lift to drink and the attached pocket tends to slide up.  I will order the regular one and use this just for special needs with the pocket.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I'm only giving this product a 4 star rating b/c the hat is so terrible.  It really is ugly and fits funny, plus it doesn't even look like a conductor hat.  Other than that, I loved the actual &#34;body&#34; of the costume.  I had a hard time finding a Thomas costume for my 18 month (25 lbs) old since the toddler aged one said &#34;one-size&#34; fits all...but then I found this costume.  This is perfect for an 18month old and even a bit older...probably til 2 yrs.  The picture shows a baby wearing it that is clearly younger than even 12 months...so don't be deceived.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Makes black paint look amazing! Easy to use, clear instructions, and it oddly enough smells very good. Hides small scratches and chips well, larger chips not so much. Have a few sets of gloves and plenty of microfiber towels handy when using this.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Have had this mug for well over two years, and it has really held up.  Although, the Migo mug isn't the best for insulating, it does insulate (not too important for my need).  The lid does leak if it isn't tightened properly.I keep the mug on a table near my bed (I'm bedridden) usually filled with water for taking medicines.  The non-skid bottom of this mug (the reason why I chose it!) is extremely helpful for someone, like me, who has uncoordinated movements and an imbalanced (muscular-wise) body.  I am in need of this particular item because my physical handicap dictates it.My physical issues are due to a neuro-muscular disease/disorder (supposedly supported by MDA) that is both debilitating and degenerative and involves the progressive loss of coordination and muscle strength leading to motor incapacitation and the inevitable confinement to a wheelchair.  In my experience, MDA is a JOKE!  I have learned that MDA attempts to make everyone believe that they are out to help people like me, but instead, exploit us for their own selfish monetary gain!  During my lifetime of 45 years, realistically, MDA hasn't done anything for my disease/disorder -- not even a simple treatment!</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I purchased this item and received it very quickly as always. I used the clippers right away and found that they cut very nicely and fit very well on my 105 pound German Shepherds nails. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the rubber grips are simply slid on the handles, They are not adhered in place which I found to be a slight problem. I will somehow adhere them in place. Otherwise, this product would be 5 stars.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I'm glad I tried taking this.  I have so much  more energy and most of my pain is gone in my joints and back.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This one got me hooked on the series.  I have always liked Caan and now have more actors that intrigue me.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I did expect some sort of low quality product here, however, it was even worse. These do not stay closed.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I bought this for a classroom gift for my son's class. The teacher really appreciated it (and I appreciated that it was a lot less expensive than buying smaller packs of pencils).</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I scanned over 2400 Ektochrome slides, over 3000 photos and over 1000 35mm film strips using this scanner and was pleased with the results. Being able to scan 12 35mm slides and four to six photos at a time is a tremendous time saver.If you expect to load the film in the scanner and push one button and have the scanner/software do the rest, you will be disappointed. If you are willing to do a minimal amount of work you can get excellent results in a reasonable amount of time.As of February 2012 all the delivered software will install on Windows 7. I installed all the software on a Windows 7 64 Bit Professional system and had no problems. I also has no problems with crashes or other software malfunctions while using the software.As mentioned in other reviews the provided documentation is extremely minimal and using the scanner/software requires extension experimentation and trial and order. Two sites providing detailed technical reviews of the scanner and software which I found useful are:[...]I used the Epson software for all my scanning. I tried the provided Silverfast SW and a trial version of VueScan but found that the Epson software best took advantage of the features of the V700 scanner. With the other software I could never scan 12 slides of multiple photos in one scan. The Silverfast web site indicates that they will provide a free upgrade to their latest version, but they haven't updated that version for the V700 so I did not bother with it.I scanned my slides and 35 mm film strips at 4800 DPI to JPEG files with the Epson software using the HOME mode with color restoration enabled. As far as I can determine the Home Mode is the only mode that allows you to scan 12 slides or multiple film strips at one time. The Professional mode seems to only allow you to scan one slide at a time. It took 10 to 15 minutes to scan 12 slides at 4800 DPI. The automatic marqueeing or outlining seemed to work pretty well in this mode. I used the Prescan option to check the images before final scanning.The slide numbering scheme in the slide holder is9  5  1  White dots10  6  211  7  312  8  4For scanning slides, negatives or film strips the document mat should be removed.I scanned my photographs with the Epson software using the Professional mode. I scanned the photos at 1200 DPI to JPEG files with color restoration enabled. The Professional Mode allows you to scan multiple photos in one scan. I was able to scan four to six photos in one scan using this mode depending on the size of the photos. After the photos are Pre-Scanned it is necessary to marquee or outline them manually before final scanning. However, the Epson software remembers the marquees or outlines from  scan to scan so if you place the photos in the same position from scan to scan you can minimize the manual marqueeing usually having to adjust only one of them. It takes about three to four minutes to scan six photos at 1200 DPI.The Home mode allows you to scan multiple photos without manual outlining or marqueeing but does not allow photoshop like correction to be made during the scan.The photo numbering scheme for six photos is;TOP2  14  36  5For scanning photographs or documents the document mat should be installed.I did a Web search to determine what DPI to use for scanning. This search seemed to indicate that for archiving slides or negatives 4000 DPI was sufficient and for photos 600 DPI was sufficient. The V700 seems to only scan at discrete DPI's so using anything other than what the Epson software provides(Silverfast or VueScan) results in software interpolation being done.If you want to verify what DPI your scanned picture are you can use Adobe Photoshop to do this:Open the digital image in PhotoshopSelect Image->Image SizeResolution will be shown in pixels per inch.Problems I had using the scanner and software:1. As another reviewer mentioned the software sometime has problems with imageswith dark borders. I had this problem with 4 or 5 slides and it requiredplaying around with different modes and options to get around the problem2. The colors in several of my photos/slides of red/orange sunsets did notscan properly. They came out too blue. I could never get Epson orSilverfast to scan them properly. I had to use Photoshop to adjust thecolor and even then it did not correctly match the original.Summary:All in all the V700 scanner and software worked very well and I would recommend it.I did not find the Epson software to be terrible as some reviewers have indicated.I experienced no crashes or serious bugs when using the software. The Abort processing even worked correctly even though that is a feature that often doesn't work properly.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I chose this item after reading other reviews.  However, I returned it - it is extremely loud, the steam vents out the top, under wood cupboards and I had a very difficult time pouring water in the skinny opening without getting everything wet. It is a good looking pot and made very good coffee.  If these issues aren't deal breakers for you, by all means go for it. By the way, the color is on the front only - so from the side what you see is the frosted/clear area of the water reservoir which goes 3/4 of the way around.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Good product for the price.  The switch worked perfectly.  I used to have a plastic outlet box that  had a defective switch and had it  replaced.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>First day I tried to install it I first was testing it.  It actually worked perfect out of the box. So I set it aside and left it on while I went about making a mounting bracket for it.  About 5 minutes later - I noticed when I handled it the housing was quite warm (not hot - but quite warm - not sure if this normal).  Just about the time I finished making a bracket and went to install it - the image started cutting in and out.  Wiggling the wires seems there might be a loose wire in the harness somewhere.  Funny - I did not notice this when I was first playing with it.  Eventually - even if I moved the wire to the point that it would work - the image on the screen was full of diagonal lines and not visible.  It's dead now.  It had a lifespan of about 30 minutes.  Typical Chinese crap.  If you get lucky and get a good one, you get a good deal.  But it's always a crap shoot.  And my luck as a gambler has always been bad.  Buyer beware.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Neat invention, just got it and it does exactly what it says it does, so far.

He has only played with it once. The beyblades themselves were great and he will be able to use them with his other sets.The Dome was quite simple to assemble, in all it's cheap plastic glory, but useless as a battle dome. It is still sitting in his room as I didn't want to have to ship it back. If I was more ambitious I would have returned this horrible toy the minute I realized how inferior it was. Don't waste your money on this toy and definetely don't let your children waste a hard earned allowance on it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This watch was way better than I expected! Money well spent:)</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The ac works well, it would be nice to have a remote but I guess that's what you get for this price. As for people complaining about not cooling well enough, I think a lot of them are either using it in too large of a space or want to live in a refrigerator over the summer. Im sure that there's a few that are actually deficient, but what I mean is there are always people who want it really cold. I suggest that if you have doubts about its cooling abilities, don't just look at the temperature, look at the humidity too, that's a big part.I looked through the reviews hoping to find something about this, but it seems like i'm the only one, so it could be from something else. But i've noticed that when using the ac excessively (at least 12 hrs a day, if not 24) in the summer, I start to get throat problems. This starts with some irritation but then progresses into a full fledged sore throat. Very annoying. Getting it checked out with the doctor soon, but I went to one before and he didn't seem to see a relationship.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>It has been a year later and still working well.  Seemed identical to the original part.  I would buy it again.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Solid cable. I always love MediaBridge products as I know I'm getting quality. Hooked right up and I know I'll never have issues with it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This product works wonders over the winter months.  I didn't realize how it prevents dry skin until after I stopped using it for a few days during the winter.  From my experience, this product doesn't leave an oily film on your face or make you shine for hours under the lights.  Unlike other products, I don't feel like a teenager going thru acne again.The price for the quality is worth it and the amount you need to apply makes the cost per application comparable to other products.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I got tired of sitting on the patio and having nasty flies buzzing everywhere, so I got one of these to try.  It warned that it did have an odor, so I hung it (use wire, it's heavy when you fill it with water) about 15 feet from the patio from a bird feeder hook.  Oh, my gosh.  Within a couple of hours there were already probably 20 flies in there and many more crawling on the bag that hadn't yet figured out how to get in.  But in the morning, they had.  I'm going to buy several more when next summer comes around and hang them along my fence. If you hang them with the logo side away, they don't have anything on the back, and it's not so glaring.  Then when you're finished with the trap, you just push the yellow button back down and throw the whole thing away with no mess.  I highly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>These socks are comfortable and soft.

It's worth it just for Page and Bonham tearing it up on &quot;In My Time of Dying.&quot; That song just ROCKS. There's such a wide variety of sounds on here, and it was all recorded during the time when Robert Plant's voice was at its best. Definitely a must have.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Finally, Galvatron surfaced the real look which he is supposed to have long time ago... Love that Menacing look on his face... the Brute action poses... wished it was a bigger figure - a voyager or an ultra class level... had a lot of room for improvement. It does easily detach when transforming... other than that, a cool figure to own!</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>There were reports of a potential fire hazard on this and similar lights... whether this actually posed a fire hazard or not remains to be seen, but the currant limiting resistor did get very VERY hot. The design of the light electrically is very basic and the quality of the soldering inside is very poor. The LED's are all linked in parallel, with one large 2.2 ohm resistor connected in series to limit the current. The stats are these:6V supply (4*1.5V cells)2.2 Ohm resistorLED voltage drop 3.3V-> 2.7v voltage drop on resistor-> 1.2A current!= 3.2 Watts dissipated (wasted) through resistorThis really is no good at all so I changed the internals ever-so-slightly...Where the power connects the the LED PCB, remove the cross-links (actually the legs of one of the LEDs) so the boards are not connected to each other at that point.At the opposite end connect the bottom left track to the top right and remove the other cross-link.And that's it. I've up loaded an image of this for you to refer to.The stats are now these:6V supplyLED voltage drop = 2*2.9V (now 2 sets of 12 LEDs in series)-> 0.2V drop across resistor-> 0.06A current= 0.012 Watts dissipated through resistor.Now the light will be quite a bit dimmer, but now the run-time can be measured in days rather than hours and there'll be absolutely no over heating of the resistor.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>I purchased this toy for my son and he loves it. He said that the limbs can rotate and come off but you can stick them back on. He also said that the second head can't go on the toy but he still likes it. Great toy!</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I love Godzilla. Let me state that again..I LOVE GODZILLA! I'm a fan of the entire series from \"King of All Monsters\" to \"Final Wars\". I own every film available on DVD, I own the video games, I own quite a few of the soundtracks on CD and I will be the first in line when \"vs. Biollante\", \"vs. Megalon\" and \"1985\" hit DVD and pay whatever is asked just so I can complete my collection. Yes, I can even sit through the Matthew Broderick travesty that bears the name \"Godzilla\".That being said....I'm not sure how anyone, fan or non-fan, can enjoy \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\"???? This film is so astonishingly awful, it veers way off of the \"So Bad It's Good\" track onto the simply horrible realm at about 20 minutes in. I love bad b-movies, I'll sit back and watch \"Mesa of Lost Women\" or \"Eegah\" all day long, but \"Kong vs Godzilla\" is mind numblingly awful. Where to begin....1. King Kong does not look like \"King Kong\". This ratty ape suit looks like it's barely holding together, and the nightmarishly barely animated hand-puppet face used for close ups of the giant ape is grade school level F/X at best.2. While having a strong plot isn't exactly key to a successful Godzilla film, Kong's storyline is so minimal as to not exist. Basically a company has found out these island berries can get you intoxicated, so they want to steal them. Unfortunately they happen to be King Kong's drink of choice as well. So basically the events of the film occur because some Japanese folks and King Kong both want to get high! Godzilla only gets involved because the worlds worst submarine captain doesn't understand that iceburgs don't simply float on top of the water, and that most of the ice is actually below the water's surface, thus ramming his nuclear sub into Godzilla's ice prison.3. The UN / American footage. I don't know if watching the original Japanese version of this film would help much, but the American version with the narrator/UN report guy is amazingly dull. For some reason there is a space station shown, and some maps, a Japanese correspondant who doesn't know how to wear headphones....and everybody is watching the events unfold on a 10\" color TV screen? The American scientist is awful as well, you have to love when he holds up a small gumball and states that it is the size of Godzilla's brain??? What???4. The fight scenes are dull. If nothing else you can usually rely on Toho films to provide some decent monster fights in their films...not so much here. Sure Godzilla and Kong meet for a final showdown about 10 minutes before the film ends...but it's just bad...and worse there really isn't a conclusion.Luckily, Godzilla would go on to much better things after this third entry in the series. I guess as a Godzilla fan I'm happy to have this disk in my collection, I can't imagine I'll pull it out very often (maybe in another 10 years or so?), but as a completist I had to own it.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Put aside for a minute the fact that Ocean's Twelve was undoubtedly made with the primary purpose of giving its A-list cast an excuse to lounge around in southern Italy for a few months. Put aside also the fact that this is a sequel to the decent (though unspectacular) Ocean's Eleven of a few years ago, which was itself a remake of an earlier (again unmemorable) star vehicle for Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack. The bloodlines of this franchise have been diluted more than European royalty.Take Ocean's Twelve for what it is: an entertaining heist movie with a fairly porous plot that nevertheless yields some good moments. High art it is not, but I found myself enjoying the ride while it lasted.There are a million reasons why this film shouldn't work, but the cast and crew do manage to pull a competent flick together in between the off-screen debauchery and carousing. Have fun with it; these guys certainly did.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron. I can style my hair any way I like and it's so easy to use.

Lacking that one's wealth of enthralling songs, it nevertheless impresses with its own gems like Still Learning How To Crawl, Sleeping In The Devil's Bed and The Unbreakable Chain. The folky song with snatches of French here is The Collection of Marie Claire while Unbreakable Chain, the moving story of a mother and son's reunion, has that same French feel. Another touching song is Lotta Love with its chiming guitars, a tale of addiction and redemption. Indian has Native American drumming and reminds me slightly of Joni Mitchell's Lakota on Chalk Mark In A Rainstorm. The production is magical, as to be expected from Lanois: atmospheric instrumentation - including evocative synths - backing his soulful voice. This is a very good album offering much in the way of stirring, memorable music and Lanois remains true to his vision.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This works great and comes with a warranty.

I wasn't expecting any miracles or a cheap face lift, so when I did see a subtle but noticeable difference, that was good enough for me. The effect isn't long lasting, and is certainly more effective on fine lines -- I know because I also tried it on those deeper furrows between my brows -- and I guess that's why it's marketed for those fine lines around the eyes. Although there is a subtle improvement of those fine lines, the difference just isn't enough to be worth the price, in my opinion. Instead, I'll work at wrinkle prevention by sticking with my Olay moisturizer.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>It was exactly what I was looking for.

NOT a garbage COMMA truck transformer. A waste management garbage truck transformer. I know, just take a minute to let the awesome sink in. Transformer Animate Wreck-gar is a great toy. His color palette of oranges, tomato reds, grays and ochres are a homage to his original G1 character. The truck is nice example of the translation from Animated's visual stylizing to physical toy. I especially the lifting arms gimmick on the front. I only wish the truck windows had been rendered in clear plastic, which shouldn't have been hard to do since it's a solid non transforming facade. (also the headlights and tail lights are transparent plastic with paint apps over them?!)The transformation is easy, but my Wreck-gar is pretty solid when pegged together and stiff in some joints so he might be more difficult for younger hands. Again your Wreck-gar may vary. He basically transforms out of his truck back which becomes a backpack in robot mode. Since it actually *was* a backpack in the show, this is one of the few cases of a backpack-former where it makes sense. I wish the door on the back of his truck mode opened so he could actually use the 'backpack' in robot mode like on the show. But, the storage of his weapons in a hidden pocket kinda make up for the backpack issues Robot mode is sweet. Captures the characterization perfectly down to the little details, crooked smirk, robo-facial hair and antenna on his TV head. Fairly poseable with articulated hands, and the light piping in the eyes works amazingly better than I expected. Oddly he only displays an Autobot symbol in vehicle mode.All in all, Animated Wreck-gar is a good solidly build and cleverly designed figure. I'd recommend for kids, collectors, fans of the show, fans of Weird Al, garbage truck enthusiasts... He originally retailed for about 20 bucks and sometimes goes for around 40 MISB on some sites, but if you can find him for around 20-25 or so he's great quirky bot. \"Dare to be Stupid,\" Indeed!And remember parents: If you don't like challenging your children, BUY AGE APPROPRIATE.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I use it primarily in my laser printer.

The cabinets are installed just inches apart which gave me the expanse I needed at a lower cost than buying the higher end Kohler line.  I think Kohler could do a much better job advising customers of the options available to achieve the look.  Do not buy ganging hardware if you are going to go this route.  Customer service advised me to leave a small gap between the cabinets.  By putting a bit of shiny aluminum on the wall between the cabinets, looks good and almost wall to wall mirrors. Great price and ship service from vendor.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Works great with my 320 fps pistol and when im not using my pistol i just stick my ipod to it and watch netflix so it really comes in handy! very satisfied and highley recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>what i was expecting and works great.

As for longevity, it's too soon to tell</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>IMO, there are two pocketable megazoom cameras on the market with the highest image quality.  They are the Canon SX260 and this Panasonic ZS15.  In addition to high image quality (the most important feature IMO), both cameras are about the same size (large end of pocketable) and both have about the same optical zoom.  However, there are still reasons to choose the Panasonic ZS15.  The main reason for me (and the one most reviewers never mention) is the extra optical zoom up to 25x if you limit the image size to 5 MPix which is large enough for a quality 8x10 inch print.  Then there is an extra 2x zoom for a total of 50x which is apparently an interpolated digital zoom involving a little image quality degradation.  (The camera has a digital zoom in addition to the 50x which I never use.  I can use digital zoom on a computer after the fact.)  So, with 25x true optical zoom and the ability to get a shot at 50x if necessary, this is an amazing camera.  It has aperture and shutter priority settings as well as manual. These features are also important although the intelligent automatic mode (iA) does well in many conditions.  There is also an intelligent resolution feature which adds beautiful sharpness to many photos.  That feature is always present in iA and may be included in the other settings as well.There are three other features that made me choose the Panasonic ZS15.  1. It does not have a GPS which is a power draining option that I never use in a camera.  (I tend to know where my photos were taken - close enough.)  2. It does not shoot RAW which I never do.  3. By omitting features 1 & 2, the price of the Panasonic is significantly below the Canon (typically $70 although prices change frequently.)</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>No screws!

She doesn't need to carry a purse with her.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Taproot have been called an Alice in Chains imitation. They are not. Welcome is one of the most creative disks in the Hard Rock genre. Unfortunately, they took a different direction after Welcome (October 2002) with Blue Sky Research (August 2005).2002's Welcome separated Taproot from the generic Nu Metal infestation of this decade with off-time beats most clearly heard in songs like Everything, Fault and Sumtimes. Poem was Welcome's claim to radio play and it was a great, foot stompin' rocker. There were different styles and sounds to the tunes on Welcome, and the songs didn't have the Nu Metal Nickelback epidemic of not being able to tell when the track has changed.Sure, Taproot clearly was influenced by Alice in Chains. In fact, Toby Wright, Welcome's producer, even co-produced some AiC disks. And singer Stephen Richards has an unmistakably clear singing voice that is a bit similar to the late, great Layne Staley.But Taproot were definitely their own band on Welcome and put out one of the most unique sounding hard rock disks of 2002.Unfortunately, Taproot lost some of their unique sound with Blue Sky Research, and went to the Nickelback monochromatic formula for some odd reason. My guess it was pressure from their label (Atlantic) to take the fun and creativity out of the music and make more radio friendly music (indeed they hired Billy Corgan [Smashing Pumpkins] to help with some of the Blue Sky tracks).This past summer drummer Jarrod Montague revealed on Taproot's MySpace blog that the band had parted ways with Atlantic Records. So hopefully Taproot's 4th release will get back to the music that made them unique and hard.Hard rockers looking for something mostly unique with a bit of an Alice in Chians Dirt influence should absolutely pick up Welcome.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>When we realized that we couldn't use it to make frozen tortoise bites, we just kind of tossed it somewhere.

So, this product comes with new standards in bluetooth headset (Ultra Light weighted, dual microphones with ultimate noise cancillation, unique feature pause button, If run out of juice you can just use it as mic when charging on stand, single charge 8 hr, less price) , VOICE CLARITY is fantastic....what you want to lisen still absolutely worth a try. you will love it for sure.1) Don't lisen to the people saying high volume its up to you can control the volume in your systemor on headset.2) Don't incert the earbud deep in the ears just a bit that makes you deaf for long term user for this reason earbud made bit large.3) This will work with phones & PC too and amazing performance but need blutooth transmitter(dongal with atleast 2.0+EDR+A2DP transmitter|dongal for pc to work atleast A2DP is must )4) Tested and Works with SKYPE pc version , IMP iphone SKYPE had a problem with app itself I mean the new ver of app but it works with Iphone perfectly and normally amazing clear and load5) I thought it look bigger but truth believe me its a little one and ultra light weighted so you just forget some time the you are wearing it.CONCLUSION : I used BOSE blutooth and I have one I don't say they are not good but this is amazing because it has same high quality performance without compramize but nearly 75% less price.

I once tried a non-HP refill system for my cartridge and the quality was just not the same, the ink seemed too watery and took forever to dry.

I also own the sheepskin lined leather tool belt, and this is the perfect addition.  My toolbelt was not designed to go with these suspenders so they did require some minor modification in order to use them.  My pouches do not have a continous belt so the loops that the suspenders come with do not just slide on.  I had to drill out the rivits on the loops and drill some holes in my pouches and rivit the metal part of the loop to my pouches.  I placed the rivits slightly out of center as to favor my left-side pouches.  I use that side more so it is very convienient. All the other guys on the site are extremely jealous.  These pouches (combined with my tool belt) scream &#34;Professional&#34;.  They are a little stiff in the beginning but feel incredibly durable.  I had already started to experience some severe lower back pain at times and these suspenders really take the pressure off of the lower back. My lower back dosen't feel as fatigued at the end of the day and it actually seems to make my upper back and shoulders stronger. They feel worked-out, but in a good way.One piece of advice is to follow the instructions.  They come with a pair of screw rivits to affix the leather straps to the canvas material near the middle back area.  This is so that black part of the harness does not slide back or forth on the leather straps.  WEAR THEM FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS, before securing the straps with the screw rivits.  It just takes a little while to determine exactly where you want them.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This polish is so much more beautiful in person! It sparkles a beautiful bright gold color!

Not a good thing for a product that's supposed to help keep you house safe and sanitary for your kitty poop.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Love this product!  So glad they make this.

Before I bought this AC charger I had to connect it to my PC's USB port to charge it and it took about 2 hours to fully charge.  Now I can use this AC charger to charge the sansa clip+ instead of leaving the PC on until it's charged.  The charger works as I expected and I am satisfied with it.  It arrived in the regular mail about 6 days after I ordered it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is smaller than I thought, but it holds the bobbins nice and tight so that thread doesn't get tangled.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Not the best quality but the price was right. I would recommend if you want a simple case for your phone.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Great Coffee mug. I have one for camping/hunting/hiking and one for to/from work.Some of the other travel mugs give coffee a funny taste to me but this one does not and it keeps my coffee hot for hours.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I have VERY sensitive, pale skin and this stuff has worked wonders for me. I have eczema on my upper arms and within two days this product took care of it, as in they are soft and smooth. I also use this on my face a lot. I tend have some mild rosacea on my cheeks and acne-prone skin. I use my facial anti-aging serium and then put a layer of this over my whole face and neck for moisture. After a few minutes, I then put an extra amount on my cheeks where I have the rosacea and it smooths it out and calms it down. This product has AHAs in it, so I'm surprised it didn't cause me to flare up.  As I said, I also use this on my neck, where I have always had rough, bumpy skin, and it smooths it into buttery softness. It does leave a bit of a 'tacky' feeling for a few hours, but I only use it at night. I REALLY wish Eucerin would make this exact product (NO SPFs as they irritate my skin beyond belief!) into a face lotion that absorbs well into facial skin (it's non-comodonogenc so it does not exactly absorb into the skin, but sits on top more). I've tried some of their face lotions and was not that impressed. I think Eucerin needs to approach their face lotions from their current line of body moisturizers and tweak them slightly. I want my facial moisturizer to be super moisturizing, have urea in it, have anti-aging benefits, and feel like I have nothing on it at all. Not asking much, I know!!  But, I know it's possible and I know Eucerin can do it because they have made a magical product in this moisturizer. For the record, I hate their original body lotion!  It's greasy and doesn't seem to do much to help my skin out. Give this a try!  If you hate it, you can always use it on your feet, it makes them super soft too!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>love the company.  love the ingredients.  my 2 yr old loves them, and asks for them too  definitely recommend this multi</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The cap fits perfectly on my mid to large sized head.The material is well crafted (it holds it shape and cleans well), the colors are nice and contrasty, and the design is stylish (if you are into the skateboard and related subcultures).The size adjustments on the back cover a wide range of sizes, so I believe the claims of this cap being one size.A great addition for your cap collection.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I'm starting to focus more on my artwork, but hadn't really gotten any experience with coloring my work.  I've found that the tablet has made it a lot easier to learn (since you can undo mistakes with the click of a button) and explore different styles without going through tons of paper/supplies.I'd only recommend a drawing tablet if you have some experience though.  It's better to learn the basics with a real pencil.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I got organic cotton breastpads originally thinking I'd save $$ and the hassle of having to re-buy pads over and over.  After a few nights of waking up with those soaked through and shirt and sheets wet, I decided to try several disposables.  I liked these the best of all.  Even if I wake up after 6 hours (my baby sleeps now that long at night), the pads are really full but no leaking!  And what's best is while I know they are full of milk, I don't feel wet.  I still use the cotton pads while at home during the day, but use these at night and when going out.  Very happy!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I was like so many other people who were led to believe that the Excalibur dehydrator was the best one. Maybe it's really great, but this dehydrator, which costs approximately half of the Excalibur price after figuring in all the add-ons necessary to get it working, actually has the same features, and dare I say: even more.This model has ten trays. The Excalibur has nine. This model comes with two nonstick liners and a device to close off four trays' width for times when you want to take them out to place rising dough or culturing yogurt in it instead. You need to buy those things at extra cost for the Excalibur model.  Neither model has a timer. Both models have adjustable temperature.The STX does not heat up my kitchen. That's really nice since I prefer to dehydrate rather than cook during the 105+ degree summer weather. It takes up a large part of my biggest counter. I planned on that, so for me it's not a hardship. I just made extra space on my other counters.I have had this machine running continuously for five days now, since a couple of days after I got it. When I first turned it on it exuded a burning sort of smell, which concerned me. In the manual it says to run it for 45 minutes at 95 degrees. So I did that, and after approximately 5 minutes the smell went away. It hasn't come back since. It is also very quiet. I believe the people who say this machine is noisy have never owned a dehydrator before. I owned a Nesco model from the late 1990's. Now that thing was noisy! This one sounds like running a small fan, which is mostly what it is. No, it's not pretty. It looks very utilitarian, and it is.I would advise anyone who is looking at the Excalibur and shaking their head at the expense to try this dehydrator. It really works nicely.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Maybe a little sweeter than I prefer, but the crowd at work loved them. It makes, making cookies, fast and easy.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>In reading the reviews about this lens I really started to want one for my Canon EOS, but then I realized that for about the same money, my S95 Powershot gives me similar lens capabilities and it's a self contained camera with excellent ISO range.  Probably isn't going to give quite the image quality that this lens will, but it's very impressive.  I think if you're considering buying this lens and you're not a pro and don't like lugging around a your big DSLR all the time you will love the S95.  Don't get me wrong, I still want the 28mm too!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>my kids love these on their bikes and they were cheap too. Not too noisy either. it was worth the money</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I kind of feel it is not fair of me to post such a low score because I did not keep the keyboard.  Obviously I didn't realize it at the time but it did not serve my purpose as I needed something that would connect to my ipad so I could use as a single unit (think small laptop) and for that reason this just didn't fit what I was looking; I did however purchase another version where of the Anker product that served as a hard case as well as a key board and I really like it.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The bands that come with this set are similar quality to what we use for rehab and personal training where I work.  They are a great set of bands for the price.  The chin up bar is pretty solid, although I haven't used it yet because it was missing one bolt to complete the assembly.  Easier to just go to home depot and find one to match it.  But the construction of the chin up bar is solid and I'm excited to get it up and use it. It's much better than one of those plain old bars you mount in the doorway, it was has the opportunity to do a variety of hand placements and therfore work differnet muscle groups.  All in all, I'm glad I purchased this product, wouldn't take it back.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It has been two weeks using it, but so far no hiccup anything.  Hope, it will survive for long of period.  All my wireless devices are happy no drop. If you guy have Wireless IP camera this router is for you. Solid no drop.  Compare with another previous my router, this one is 100% stable. I love it so far.  Will update more if something is wrong, but hope not...  Buy it if you have wireless secure ip camera or...  It is rock...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I currently have last generation Panasonic 3D glasses, as well as Xpand X103's and this blow both of them out of the water.  Extremely light weight, the lenses seem to be a little brighter, and they have the ability to convert 3D images back to 2D if you are watching with a group of people and decide you want to watch it in 2D instead.  Will definitely be replacing my other glasses with these over the next few weeks.  The only downside to these that I have found, is they do not come with a storage case, and they don't fit in the last generation storage case.  I haven't found anything that they fit in just right to keep from the lenses getting scratched.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>A giant POS that does not work. I guess you get what you pay for, right? Or in this case...you pay for nothing.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The bulk packing of this product made me wonder if this cheap-light weight-looking device really works...It does!! (Though I don't know how long... sorry...but the looking and feeling of this product is not giving me too much confidence)For people who wants to know if it charges your ipad at same time ... it does not (I use ipad 3).</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I had this bottle for at least six months now and I got to say, it works great. Here are some Pros that I found:1) The bottle is affordable.2) The bottle is durable. It is made out of plastic, but it is hard plastic that returns to its original shape when you squeeze it.3) It looks great. The bottle itself looks very sleek and shiny, making it nice to take anywhere from your house, to work, gym, when you are running, and everything in between. I personally use it when going to gym and when I am in my college dorm.4) The water tastes great. I hate the water in my college dorm. It tastes horrible. With this, I can't taste that awful chlorine or as I call it \"pipe\" taste.5) The tether that you can use to carry your bottle with one finger is attached to the cup. When you unscrew the cap, you can either push the cap down where it is attached to the bottle, making it easier to drink your water, or you can pull it all the way up and hold it with your hand while drinking.6) The little filter indicator under the filter lets you set a month when you bought your filter so you will know when to change it again (every 3 months or so, depending on your usage).7) A gentle squeeze gets a lot of water going through the filter, and the filter allows air to go in after you let go of the bottle. This is pretty quiet.I am very happy with this bottle. I think it makes the water taste great and I've noticed I drink a lot more water now, which is always a plus.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>For the money, not the best quality - I would think again about purchasing this product.  Material is thin and may not hold up too well.  Received this tool box as a gift.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I hesitated at first to buy this after reading some of the negative reviews from others but saw there was room for misunderstanding by people who tried to use this for grinding large nuts and non-oily grains which it was never designed to process. Pumpkin seed kernels are marginally too large. It is made to grind poppy seeds and works equally well for similar seeds like sesame, flax, chia... and you can mix-in fractional amounts of dry spices like black pepper, nigella, sichuan pepper, annato, lemon peel, garlic granules, etc. If you mistakenly try to grind almonds the first large nut into the grinder mechanism will push the screw feeder to one side where it could jam and will cause excessive wear. The small seeds by contrast distribute themselves in the grinder and create a lubricating layer between the inner and outer surfaces. This mill can be a tool to change your diet to include many tasty, healthy spices and seeds.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Bought this for my 2013 Ford F150 with 6.5 foot bed. Very heavy duty, excellent quality, and fits perfectly. Very pleased, can recommend this product without reservation. But keep in mind it does not cover the tail gate, just the bed of the truck.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My Monday morning started with enough deodorant for one arm. As I ran through the house grabbing my coffee and looking for my keys, I hastily placed an order for more deodorant (with next day shipping). When it arrived, I realized that I had ordered Degree Clinical Protection instead of Secret Clinical Strength. Oops.I assumed that they are both made by people in white lab coats and work basically the same for people who need a little extra help in the scent control department. But, I found that the Degree deodorant lasted much longer than the Secret I had been using. Not only did I still feel fresh at the end of the day (after spending two hours commuting in August), I felt reasonably dry and smell free after walking several miles at the gym that evening.The scent is very clean but not overpowering. It simply smells fresh. Also, I was able to wear it with a black shirt and not find any stains or smudges (this has to be attributed to the product and not user skill).The only thing that I noticed is that the product that I received is slightly different than the one pictured. This might be a simple change in packaging. The one I received also says \"24H MotionSense Motion Activated Freshness\" and I don't see that in the product that is pictured.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>it is very very cool but the little metal holding the periodic table from going in the pen falls off and the paper gets bend up a little but it is pretty good</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I purchased this item at the very end of August 2011 and I am currently running a disk check on it because S.M.A.R.T. said that a failure is imminent.

Now I have to figure out how to return the darn thing under warranty.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Initial testing works perfectly!

She loved the idea and the kids started playing with it right away!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It was easy to install, easy to set up with my Mac and Time Machine, and when I messed up a file I just went back a couple of days and snatched the one I wanted.

You waste your money buying it.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is the western for which Clint Eastwood ought to have won his Oscars. Included on almost every important \"Best of\" list for 1976, Eastwood's amazing cinematic masterpiece was all but snubbed by the Academy. That he was finally recognized for the much-inferior \"Unforgiven\" is a shameful irony. The western genre was in decline by the 1970s and had largely devolved into cliche or cartoonish parody. The genius of Eastwood's vision was to take traditional western stereotypes and turn them on their heads, demythologize the rigidly black/white good-vs-evil Saturday matinee morality, and show us characters with real depth, real motivations and real inner conflicts; not always \"good\" or always \"bad\" but sometimes walking a fine line, driven to one side or the other by circumstances beyond one man's control. The look of the film is gorgeous, showing us a smokey, autumnal by-gone world, sometimes crude, often gritty. It's not clear we'd want to live in such a time or place, but we are drawn in nonetheless. Wonderful acting, and a whole passel of great character actors, including the inimitable Chief Dan George, bring the story to vibrant life. There's plenty of action to keep the adrenaline flowing, and the story draws to a logical, satisfying, if artfully understated, conclusion. The score is also worthy of note; spare and expansive all at once, it ranks as one of the best to come out of the 1970s. This is absolutely-must-see.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>when i ordered these i was looking for a 4mm crystal bead and these are not true to size as all of the other 4 mm beads i use. they are slightly larger then the other beads. while they still work fine for what i am making i just would have liked to have known before i purchased and i would have bought a different one.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This charger is great.

I don't have any issue with heat. I need things to be very hot for my pallet. That being said, I found this in a local grocery store and honestly didn't have much hope for it. I've tried other &#34;Ghost&#34; sauces, only to find out the Ghost pepper is the LAST ingredient (meaning minimal use, ie NOT HOT)! So when I found this I put a healthy splash on my plate and dove right in. I was GREATLY surprised!! This sauce is quite hot for a little bottle I found next to Sriracha! It caught me off-guard and is even hotter than some Scorpion pepper sauces! This is the real deal and has GREAT taste! By far recommended over anything else.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>words just DO NOT do this album justice. these guys rock. hard. they're an awesome live band.

She loves them and plays with them a lot.  The heads fall off but she just puts them back up and still plays.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Unfortunately missed the deadline to return by 3 days, but the product has terrible range.  I got a bluetooth speaker I've been using in the shower for months and had it running off my phone which sits at my computer desk, and for $9 I figured I'd be able to drop the hassle of switching between my computer and phone for music when I took a shower and have a more seamless audio experience (when I disconnect the bathroom speaker and get out, the computer speakers would pick back up).  Unfortunately, the dongle seems to be good for about 10 feet of range and starts stuttering at 15.  At 20 feet in the bathroom with the door wide open, it's simply unusable, akin to streaming music over a dialup connection.  When it connects.So if you need a bluebooth connection for devices that will sit a foot or two away, or even 10, I'm sure the product works fine, but falls well below the standard of 30 feet.  For comparison, I've never had music from my phone skip which, as stated, sits on my computer desk so same distance.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This Oster hand mixer is nothing special. Putting it blatantly.Jumping right in, let's look at the beaters. Easy to click in, hard to get off. Also, they seem to be on the shorter side.It doesn't offer much power. Simple cookie doughs I've found defeat this mixer. Not just defeat, mind you, but beats it to the point that it smells as if the motor is about to catch fire. Oh, and lets not forget the smoke while all that's going down.The speed settings are nice but when you really get down to it, 6 speeds is a bit much. A simpler 3 speed with more power would have been more desired. The differences from 2 to 3, or 4 to 5 aren't that significant.Finally, the cord is a little short. You gotta be close to an outlet or else you won't be using this bad boy without an extension cord, which seems a bit ridiculous.All in all, yes, this does come with a nice bowl and lid that makes for easy and neat storage but it just comes up too short in the power department to warrant a purchase from someone actually looking to do any amount of real cooking with it. Pass.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I've always loved this 1938 Shirley Temple film, which bears little or no relationship to thechildren's book of the same name.  Shirley plays a talented orphan, Rebecca Winstead, who wins a radio contest, and despite some twists and turns in the plot, eventually finds stardom in New York.  The film closes with Shirley and Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson in a great tap routine to Raymond Scott's hit, \"The Toy Trumpet.\"  William Demarest, Gloria Stuart, Jack Haley, and Randolph Scott are among the featured character actors in the film.This film - in both B&W; and colorized versions - is a must-have for Temple fans of all ages.  It features English fake stereo and mono soundtracks, a Spanish soundtrack, and subtitles in both languages.  Enjoy.This is the last Shirley Temple movie that I will review, as I don't intend to buy any more, unless POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL finally makes it to U.S. DVD. R.I.P., dear Shirley...</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Did a transfer of old 650GB drive to this 2TB moinster.

Also its very easy for the plug that covers the charging port to be stretched out or bent the wrong way.

I had trouble choosing which fisheye lens (Opteka, Bower, Rokinon), mostly because I thought that ten more dollars more for the Opteka lens would get me a better lens. However, I found out that the fisheye lenses are actually made from the same company, but have other names on them (Opteka, Bower, Rokinon). This was the wisest decision I made (the extra ten dollars got me one day shipping).The lens itself is quite heavy, heavier than my nikkor 18-55 and 55-200. I didn't let that bother me. I don't want to get into technical specs, so the only thing I have to say is this fisheye lens does not have vignetting. Some people like that, some people don't.  The distortion isn't that of a \"true\" fisheye.  Without the vignetting and the distortion of a \"true\" fisheye, this lens is a wide angle lens and a fisheye lens. I was also trying to decide to invest more on a wide-angle lens rather than the fisheye, but with this package I got both. This lens by far was the best decision I made. This lens a  two in one piece of glass.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>A number of my lady friends have expressed the desire to get this wine coaster.  It looks classy and it's very useful.

It appears that this company ships in bulk by DHL to a regional postal facility where the shipment is broken down for shipment to individual addresses.

I wanted one universal remote to control both items, and this one does the job very well.  The only downside is that the programming process is a little on the tedious side (you have to hold X button while pushing Y button, then wait for Z seconds, then punch in a code, etc., etc.), and each device you could use it for has several potential four-digit codes.  You have to use trial and error to see which code works, and trying a new code requires starting the entire procedure from the start.  Once you get it programmed, though, it works like a charm.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I don't know how I happened upon this product, but I love it.  I started taking vitamin D3 several years ago, and my levels were dismally low.  It took quite a long time to build them back to normal, and most likely because I was taking relatively low doses, orally.  This product delivers a more appropriate adult dose and is meant to be dissolved under the tongue, which I understand is a better delivery method than swallowing capsules.  The vitamin K2 is not only an added bonus because most adults are deficient, but allows for better absorption of the D3.  The taste is extremely pleasant, and is almost a &#34;treat&#34; every day.  Would highly recommend and have been taking it myself with nothing but favorable results for the past year.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>They arrived even more quickly than promised.

I might be doing something wrong, of course.Still, 5 stars.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Our family has played this game a number of times, and I doubt it will ever grow old. The basic game is similar to the old parlor game, where each player has to repeat what all the players have said up to him/her, then add a new word beginning with the next letter in the alphabet. This game is a lot more fun, though, because there are cards that tell each player what to do or say. Some are to act like a certain animal (silently or with sound effects), others are to say a phrase, others to act out a certain motion. I lost last time, because although I remembered to say, \"Seriously,\" then scratch my head, then imitate the sound and motion of a snake, then pretend to swim, then say, \"Gotcha!\" then take my own pulse, and then howl at the moon like a wolf, alas I forgot that the next item in the list was to pretend to juggle. My two 10-year olds beat me 10 to 9 to zero. At first, I thought the game was so simple that for adults it might best be considered a drinking game, but after that (and other) humiliation(s) I think I'll rest up and stay cold sober in the future.There is a board and a little piece for each player that moves around, depending on how well the player does, and there is nominally a \"winner,\" but really nobody cares much about that aspect, at least they shouldn't. The real value of the game is in the cards that give such a large variety of words and actions to remember. It's a good thing there are several hundred cards!It's probably worth noting that the game is geared completely towards having fun, and the directions, while complete, are quite casual (nobody \"loses\" or \"fails,\" they just \"mess up.\"). However, the game is quite educational too, as it helps concentration and (alert: non-scientific opinion coming) maybe makes people use different parts of their brains as they remember totally different types of things--verbal, visual, and auditory. That's really why I think the game will never grow old, as the sequences and significances of the things players need to remember will always be different, even though each individual card will eventually reappear. Players, especially kids, will grow better and faster at this and other memory tasks, as well.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I couldn't find this color in stores so I opted to buy online. I love the rosy nude color. Perfect for everyday wear.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Many times when I install current wifi cards from various maufactures in desktop computers the onboard Cat5/ethernet port will interfere or disable after install and restart. Support for motherboard can sometimes be difficult to find. Installing this card (provided there is an available PCI slot) allows bypassing the motherboard port and allows either wifi or cabled connection with ease to network or internet at 10/100/1000 speeds. Simple install and Win XP/Vista/7 instant driver upgrade makes this port available imediately for use with no conflict. Excellent and easy upgrade for this price.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>It is very entertaining. I wish the show was still going on.

Yup, never buying this item thats for sure. Im not even close to impressed.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Bought this adjustable arm when wear and tear on my car dictated that I couldn't use a fixed/length arm.  Part is relatively easy to install, and VERY easy to adjust.  Not to mention, considerably cheaper than other brands.  I honestly don't see any deficiencies in this part that would indicate any other brand would've served any better for a higher cost.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The mechanics of this cutter are nice, especially the blade shield to keep your fingers from being cut when not in use. However, I found it to be very difficult to cut perfect circles with this cutter. The blade seems to have a little bit of wobble to it.</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>I will try this product again when I put up corn today.  It was awkward  to use.

I did have a choice in the matter, but had heard good things about them on internet forums, and was anxious to try them out, so I went for it.  I was really happy with the sweet ride and easy rolling of those tires, but wanted to try these skinnies for a round.  Meh, way too bumpy for me.  When they wear out, I`ll go back to those delicious 1.5 Comets.  Being stuck with this 1.35 version for the rest of that bike`s life wouldn`t be HORRIBLE, but I liked the wider version so much better that I see no reason to buy more of these.  All in all, nice tire, but gimme the big `uns!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Well built to stand the test of time (and the nutcracker is built strong as well!!!).I don't care WHO you are. This Hillary Nutcracker gets the conversation(s) going, and in a funny, lighthearted way.Want someone in the White House that doesn't have to prove how tough she is?Send one of these to every member of Congress and the Senate, then just stand back a chuckle at the knucklehead(s) that thought it was a joke............Hopefully, this will eventually end up in the Smithsonian !!!</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>This mat is a nice large size and the cats don't seem to mind it at all.  It does catch some of the litter, but not all.  I sweep it clean every day.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Easy to clean and cart from kitchen to table. Love that it includes a spoon and tray. Boston Warehouse has a bunch of these awesome porcelain kitchen items. Also bought a gorgeous fish water pitcher.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Nice, but not great.  Sturdy/solid and made of pretty good quality materials (steel and real wood)!  With the metal framework it looks classy and is better than a lot of cheap manufactured-wood shelf units. Most of the welds are done well, but a couple of the welded pieces were just a touch out of place.  The lower basket section was pretty rusted.  The paint was chipped and missing from parts of that one metal section, but since the unit has kind of an antique/rustic look (and that part is down low with the unit setting in a dark corner), it doesn't seem to ruin the looks of it unless you look very closely.  Assembly was hindered by a couple of framework holes that were a little out of place, and with the parts being made of steel it wasn't easy to persuade them to come together.  Packaging was very beat-up, though no shipping damage to the contents was evident.  The Styrofoam chunks were crushed in several places and made an awful mess as the parts were unpackaged.  It may be a little over-priced at $183, but I guess they have to pay for the free shipping somehow.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My brother got one of these for me about a year ago and I use it almost daily, I bought this one as a present and the people love it.  There is very little mess to clean up after using it, just a cup and the blade.  Much nicer than hauling out my big blender when I only want one or two cups of something mixed.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Our of 24, only 2 arrived cracked. So, you know, what are you going to do with a busted lollipop but eat it, and it tasted good. These are perfect for a child party....cute and festive, functional and inexpensive. I would buy them again.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Boxer puppy loves this ball!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This routet bit is exactly the bit I was shopping for.  It arrived in a reasonable time frame. Packing was good.  Will buy again in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This headset has stood the test of time. Still going strong over a year later. I use this on conference calls all day and what I like about it is the long battery life</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Why did it take half my life to find something like this machine? I don't get it. For an initial round of clay/compound/polish and wax took me 8 hours and a sore back. But when looking at the results...unbelievable. I am so proud of the job done. What I appreciate especially is that at no point I felt like I could create any damage to my car. When cleaning the cutting pads from the compound with a brush the pad will fly away when the speed is set to 5. So you may want to reduce that to 3 or so prior to the cleaning procedure.I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has fun to do those jobs by yourself. Tip: Make sure to watch the how-to videos at the Meguiairs website as they have helped me a lot before doing my first car.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Comfortable, light and great protection! What more can you ask from sunglasses. Comes with a case, neckcord and cleaning cloth.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>No, I wasn't expecting an Apple cover. However, with the screen protector (sold separately) installed, I don't see the need for the high dollar Apple Smart cover.This does just what I need it to do, protects the iPad from unwanted scratches in transit or storage. The stands are an added bonus (although I haven't used them yet, perhaps I will soon).My iPad fits perfectly, the cutouts align with the ports on the iPad fine.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>AC Adapter Charger works. It's cheap and it does the job. What more could I want? Word, word, word, word.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I use this for my beta fish.  I have to remove the shell, but the inside is easy to pull out and they eat all of it.  Some of the other products that are sun dried are empty inside and all hard shell and unusable.  One of my beta's is so picky and he really likes this food.  It also doesn't have alot of powdery loose waste with it.  You get almost all shrimp.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>order the fan at the same time as the replacement motor. Was charged two different shipping fees.Fan was lighter then motor and the shipping charge was over twice as much. Must have something to do with size.But the fan worked with motor so I can be to upset.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Easy to use buttons, keeps good time and a real boon for boaters and swimmers. Great product and looks good, too.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This movie was excellent. It met ALL the expectations I thought it would. I thank Spike Lee for this.. Not only did it tell us or teach us about the system(economy) but it showed us how HARD things get when your country let you down. It was very emotional at times. But overall: I rate it 5*</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I was having some initial stages of Carpal Tunnel for so much using the mouse and that's how I started considering switching to a trackball. I actually stumbled on this product at an Office Max store. I checked Amazon and their price was better. So I bought one and tried it. It took me less than a week to get used to the trackball and I simply fell in love with it. The fact that it has the same buttons as a regular mouse makes the transition a lot easier. Within a week, my wrist wasn't in pain anymore. So I bought a second one and I keep one at the office and the other one with my personal laptop. I love that I can use regular batteries for it (1 AA). The USB transmitter can be kept inside the battery compartment, which prevents you from misplacing it or losing it when travelling with it. I also love the range: I can control the pointer from across the room. My previous wireless mouse didn't have such a good range. For some people the range may be unimportant, but for people like me who sometimes have to facilitate presentations, a great range helps when you are not standing next to the computer. I have recommended this product to some of my friends and they also fell in love with it. I highly recommend it if you are looking to switch from a mouse to a trackball or if you are trying to replace another trackball model.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>So I have been searching for bedding for months and the down comfortors are so expensive that i decided to just go with the down alternative. Well i found this one and the price agreed with me and i liked the reviews for the most part. I placed my order and it came the NEXT DAY! I was super excited to get home and see my new warm comforter.. When i opened it up it was thinner than i expected and at night i get cold, its not very breathable. The outter shell is not like a traditional down blanket either, it is some synthetic fiber. Its a worth it purchase i guess, but it just wasn't what i was searching for exactly.</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>My skin became red and irritated and I had the worst break out in years after use of this product.I've never had any sort of allergy or reaction like that to any makeup of any sort until I used this!</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The Galaxy S3 locates the NFC antennae on the battery.

Extremely disappointed!!!However, as far as being here on time...and packaged well..no complaints  there...</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>I received this set as a birthday present. I am a beginner makeup lover and have been wanting a full set of brushes for sometime now. I like the set, but there is no list of what each brush is supposed to do. For a novice like myself, that is not a good thing. I opened the leather pouch to a full set of brushes, many of which looked like they do the same thing. It would be nice if there was a guide on each brush was and its purpose. Not only so makeup babies can feel like they know what they are doing, but also to make sure you got what you paid for. It's just okay, but I will be looking for another set as I get more advanced with my makeup skills. Not completely satisfied.</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>These are just O.K. It came in a set of 3 and I've gone through 2 and can not get all the air pockets out of it. I would not buy again.</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Needed a punk rock wig last minute and this worked and was inexpensive. This was a $10 (about) wig and that is what it was worth. It is thin, with some blue strands, and comes in a package so hair is flat.  This was a great wig for the price and fast delivery (with Prime).</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I really like the fit and comfort of this brace. I tore my MCL in both knees. Luckily neither was a complete tear. Wearing these braces has really helped me to get back into things. It has been 2 weeks since the injuries and I have had the braces for 10 days. I even skied with them for 3 hours 1 week after the injury (NOT recommended). I wouldn't recommend Dodge ball either. It is very rough on the knees. I wear the braces everyday at work and play. They are much more comfortable than others I have tried. I like the neoprene support of some other braces, but I couldn't stand wearing that thick tight neoprene for 12 hours a day. The support of these feels firm and stable but allows more movement throughout a long day. Even when I have to sit a lot at work, these are still comfortable.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Product was exactly as it was described and the shipping got it here in no time flat.  I've had these types of water bottles before and for the abuse I subject them to steel is the only way to go.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My new go-to when on-the-go bar!!  Delicious, healthy choice and you can't beat the price when you purchase by the case.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Wow !!!  this stuff is awesome. I'm considering building a house with it (just kidding). Only complaint is the nozzle on top. As others have reported,, it clogs up and needs a different delivery system.</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>This is a pretty neat product for anyone who likes the old Polaroid photos.  The photos printed on this system kind of have that retro, Polaroid look, but I like it.  They remind me of instagrams (and you can put a border around them like an old Polaroid). They work out to about $.60/print which is not a bad price. Polaroid film was expensive back in the day too.  I wish the prints were a little bigger, but the printer fits perfectly in my camera bag.  If they were bigger, they wouldn't be as portable.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Distribution of Ratings vs. Distribution of Ratings Containing Certain Words..."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["raw = spark.read.parquet(\"/databricks-datasets/amazon/data20K\").withColumnRenamed(\"rating\", \"label\")"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"code","source":["display(raw.groupBy(\"label\").count().orderBy(\"label\"))"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .table-result-container {\n    max-height: 300px;\n    overflow: auto;\n  }\n  table, th, td {\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n  }\n  th, td {\n    padding: 5px;\n  }\n  th {\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n</style><div class='table-result-container'><table class='table-result'><thead style='background-color: white'><tr><th>label</th><th>count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1881</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>1138</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>1696</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>3460</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>11784</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The negative reviews are substantially underrepresented here.

I researched bike racks extensively and was relieved when the rack arrived and appeared to be very high quality.  The hardware fittings are oversized, the frame is heavy duty, the padding where the bike frames rest are thick, molded rubber and the velcro straps are about 2inches wide with plenty of length to ensure confidence. There is not a single piece of plastic or cheap material on this bike rack.  It took about 30 minutes to assemble the rack and get it ready for hitch installation.  One glitch I found was that the threads on my rack were reversed.  While the instructions said to screw the bolt from the passenger side through the hitch, mine was clearly too loose after installation.  The rack needs to screw in TIGHT into the hitch.  Luckily I tried to screw it from the drivers side and it worked just fine.  There is minimal clearance between the two pieces once the rack is fully installed.  There is a heavy duty pin that allows for tilting the rack to access the trunk.Now the fun part begins.  Make no mistake, the first time you try to mount your bikes, plan for 45 minutes!  This is a game of Tetris, but once you figure out the right configuration for your bikes, the mounting should take no more than 10 minutes including straps. We ended up putting the 2 kids bikes first then the 2 adult bikes. (yes the kids bikes Require an extension bar.) Keep in mind, there will always be points where the bikes rub together, but you can minimize touch points by moving the pedals to the optimal position.  After that, we used knee and elbow pads as padding between the bikes.  This works like a charm!  The velcro straps allow for a variety of secure positions and we haven't scratched our bikes at all!The last part of securing the bikes includes straps.  It is recommened to strap any bike that uses an extension bar from the bike frame or tire to the bike rack directly.  This provides extra security should the extension bar fail, the bikes will still be strapped to the bike rack.  I usually wrap one long strap around the first pair of bikes securing them to the rack, and attach another strap to the second pair of bikes and rack.  The last strap I use is secured from the bike rack to the roof rack of my SUV.  This is actually a critical part of feeling secure!  This is an anti-sway strap that keeps the entire bike rack from moving too much when you hit a bump in the road or go over a train track.  Trust me, you want to buy this strap!Our first road trip with the bikes fully loaded took us across 4 hours of highway and country roads.  The bikes arrived without a scratch and my nerves were intact too.  We have used the rack now 10+ times and each time it gets easier.  Overall, I highly recommend this bike rack.  It is a very strong and sturdy extension of your vehicle.  The only drawback I see is that it doesn't fold down.  But the single post allows me to mount kids bikes, the tilt function is perfect and easy to use, the strength in design is obvious so I will accept the single drawback happily!</td><td>List(i, bought,

I haven't had any issues sending or receiving messages and phone calls, and it's done everything I need it to do... just not as smoothly as I think it should. I decided to write a review from the perspective of someone who has had the phone long enough to know the bugs.The touch screen worked well for the first month or two, and I finally began to get used to texting on it. Unfortunately over time the phone has become less and less responsive. (And I am not hard on electronics) It still works with a little extra pressure, but this can become frustrating. The touch sensitivity is not 100% accurate either. You'd think after a year I would be used to texting on the number keypad, but the phone frequently thinks I'm typing a key across the screen. Unfortunately, it often thinks I'm hitting the clear button when my finger is a few buttons away. Also, the phone has difficulty sensing touch in some of the menus. I can push a button 10 different ways and it still won't open sometimes.I love Tracfone, and this phone has served its purpose, but I would not recommend it. I finally am getting so fed up with trying to push buttons and navigate menus that I'm getting a different Tracfone without a touch screen.What I do love about this phone is the speaker quality for both calls and the music player. I've also had very few issues with it unlocking in my pocket and making calls. The battery life is phenomenal and will last me five days to a week with moderate usage.If you're going Tracfone (which I recommend because it is so much cheaper than everyone else!) I would suggest avoiding touch screens because they are not quite up to the standard responsiveness that we are used to. If you want a lesson in patience though, this is the way to go. ;)</td><td>List(i, ve, had, this, phone, for, almost, a, year, now, and, it, has, certainly, served, it, s, purpose, i, haven, t, had, any, issues, sending, or, receiving, messages, and, phone, calls, and, it, s, done, everything, i, need, it, to, do, just, not, as, smoothly, as, i, think, it, should, i, decided, to, write, a, review, from, the, perspective, of, someone, who, has, had, the, phone, long, enough, to, know, the, bugs, the, touch, screen, worked, well, for, the, first, month, or, two, and, i, finally, began, to, get, used, to, texting, on, it, unfortunately, over, time, the, phone, has, become, less, and, less, responsive, and, i, am, not, hard, on, electronics, it, still, works, with, a, little, extra, pressure, but, this, can, become, frustrating, the, touch, sensitivity, is, not, 100, accurate, either, you, d, think, after, a, year, i, would, be, used, to, texting, on, the, number, keypad, but, the, phone, frequently, thinks, i, m, typing, a, key, across, the, screen, unfortunately, it, often, thinks, i, m, hitting, the, clear, button, when, my, finger, is, a, few, buttons, away, also, the, phone, has, difficulty, sensing, touch, in, some, of, the, menus, i, can, push, a, button, 10, different, ways, and, it, still, won, t, open, sometimes, i, love, tracfone, and, this, phone, has, served, its, purpose, but, i, would, not, recommend, it, i, finally, am, getting, so, fed, up, with, trying, to, push, buttons, and, navigate, menus, that, i, m, getting, a, different, tracfone, without, a, touch, screen, what, i, do, love, about, this, phone, is, the, speaker, quality, for, both, calls, and, the, music, player, i, ve, also, had, very, few, issues, with, it, unlocking, in, my, pocket, and, making, calls, the, battery, life, is, phenomenal, and, will, last, me, five, days, to, a, week, with, moderate, usage, if, you, re, going, tracfone, which, i, recommend, because, it, is, so, much, cheaper, than, everyone, else, i, would, suggest, avoiding, touch, screens, because, they, are, not, quite, up, to, the, standard, responsiveness, that, we, are, used, to, if, you, want, a, lesson, in, patience, though, this, is, the, way, to, go)</td><td>List(ve, phone, almost, year, certainly, served, purpose, haven, issues, sending, receiving, messages, phone, calls, done, everything, need, smoothly, think, decided, write, review, perspective, someone, phone, long, enough, know, bugs, touch, screen, worked, well, first, month, two, finally, began, get, used, texting, unfortunately, time, phone, become, less, less, responsive, hard, electronics, still, works, little, extra, pressure, become, frustrating, touch, sensitivity, 100, accurate, either, d, think, year, used, texting, number, keypad, phone, frequently, thinks, m, typing, key, across, screen, unfortunately, often, thinks, m, hitting, clear, button, finger, buttons, away, also, phone, difficulty, sensing, touch, menus, push, button, 10, different, ways, still, won, open, sometimes, love, tracfone, phone, served, purpose, recommend, finally, getting, fed, trying, push, buttons, navigate, menus, m, getting, different, tracfone, without, touch, screen, love, phone, speaker, quality, calls, music, player, ve, also, issues, unlocking, pocket, making, calls, battery, life, phenomenal, last, five, days, week, moderate, usage, re, going, tracfone, recommend, much, cheaper, everyone, else, suggest, avoiding, touch, screens, quite, standard, responsiveness, used, want, lesson, patience, though, way, go)</td><td>List(0, 544, List(6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24, 26, 32, 34, 36, 41, 44, 46, 49, 52, 58, 61, 62, 76, 82, 83, 95, 96, 99, 109, 111, 112, 113, 122, 128, 135, 141, 142, 161, 165, 175, 177, 179, 185, 209, 214, 232, 237, 243, 261, 268, 274, 282, 284, 292, 296, 307, 310, 317, 324, 334, 347, 369, 401, 404, 418, 443, 448, 464, 467, 468), List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 8.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 5.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Could this possibley be the future, is cloning that far away.

I have used this at 3 different backcountry water sources so far without getting sick.The main drawback is that it's a little clumsy to both work the pump and balance the container, and I've accidentally dropped a water bottle into a creek.  It includes connectors for connecting directly to a hydration bladder, but it expects 1/4\" inner diameter tubing, and all the bladders I have found use larger diameter.

I'll be trying it out on my next trip in a couple weeks, and hopefully that will help with the clumsiness issue.

Bought these for a little over $100 and have hardly taken them off since.  Comfort is a 10/10.  I can wear these literally all day and not have a headache or earache.  The only time I'm bothered is with wearing glasses, and only that after 12+ hours of wearing these nonstop.  Even then it's not bad.  I often find myself wearing these without even listening to anything, they're that comfortable.As for quality, I mostly use these for playing games and listening to music.  They sound really good with a higher volume with a good balance.  They do have an open sound, which means sound leaks out rather significantly at high volumes but you don't have an &#34;inside your own head&#34; feeling like with closed headphones, so overall a positive.  I wouldn't use these out and about but I don't think I'd wear anything but earbuds outside anyway.  Quality is very good for music, hard to judge for studio use since I just don't have as much experience with higher-end headphones since I can't afford them.  However, from the studio headphones I have used, these are at least on par and will get the job done very well.  The open &#34;leaking&#34; would be my main concern for recording using a mic, but it is easily solved by keeping the volume reasonable.Overall, very happy with my purchase and the next pair of headphones I get would be another just like these unless I have the money for something top-of-the-line.</td><td>List(primary, reason, i, bought, these, is, because, i, was, looking, for, comfort, and, quality, in, an, affordable, price, range, 100, 150, bought, these, for, a, little, over, 100, and, have, hardly, taken, them, off, since, comfort, is, a, 10, 10, i, can, wear, these, literally, all, day, and, not, have, a, headache, or, earache, the, only, time, i, m, bothered, is, with, wearing, glasses, and, only, that, after, 12, hours, of, wearing, these, nonstop, even, then, it, s, not, bad, i, often, find, myself, wearing, these, without, even, listening, to, anything, they, re, that, comfortable, as, for, quality, i, mostly, use, these, for, playing, games, and, listening, to, music, they, sound, really, good, with, a, higher, volume, with, a, good, balance, they, do, have, an, open, sound, which, means, sound, leaks, out, rather, significantly, at, high, volumes, but, you, don, t, have, an, 34, inside, your, own, head, 34, feeling, like, with, closed, headphones, so, overall, a, positive, i, wouldn, t, use, these, out, and, about, but, i, don, t, think, i, d, wear, anything, but, earbuds, outside, anyway, quality, is, very, good, for, music, hard, to, judge, for, studio, use, since, i, just, don, t, have, as, much, experience, with, higher, end, headphones, since, i, can, t, afford, them, however, from, the, studio, headphones, i, have, used, these, are, at, least, on, par, and, will, get, the, job, done, very, well, the, open, 34, leaking, 34, would, be, my, main, concern, for, recording, using, a, mic, but, it, is, easily, solved, by, keeping, the, volume, reasonable, overall, very, happy, with, my, purchase, and, the, next, pair, of, headphones, i, get, would, be, another, just, like, these, unless, i, have, the, money, for, something, top, of, the, line)</td><td>List(primary, reason, bought, looking, comfort, quality, affordable, price, range, 100, 150, bought, little, 100, hardly, taken, since, comfort, 10, 10, wear, literally, day, headache, earache, time, m, bothered, wearing, glasses, 12, hours, wearing, nonstop, even, bad, often, find, wearing, without, even, listening, anything, re, comfortable, quality, mostly, use, playing, games, listening, music, sound, really, good, higher, volume, good, balance, open, sound, means, sound, leaks, rather, significantly, high, volumes, 34, inside, head, 34, feeling, like, closed, headphones, overall, positive, wouldn, use, think, d, wear, anything, earbuds, outside, anyway, quality, good, music, hard, judge, studio, use, since, much, experience, higher, end, headphones, since, afford, however, studio, headphones, used, least, par, get, job, done, well, open, 34, leaking, 34, main, concern, recording, using, mic, easily, solved, keeping, volume, reasonable, overall, happy, purchase, next, pair, headphones, get, another, like, unless, money, something, top, line)</td><td>List(0, 544, List(2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 33, 51, 58, 65, 66, 69, 76, 81, 96, 98, 99, 100, 101, 105, 107, 114, 119, 126, 131, 141, 147, 157, 161, 169, 170, 214, 216, 229, 241, 244, 246, 261, 280, 282, 283, 311, 323, 350, 356, 401, 426, 432, 461, 467, 474, 476, 487, 531, 541), List(2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>I used this product to help me fight bad breath and control tartar and even fight gingivitiswell to my disappointment this has actually made my mouth worse and created a new problem, white film is peeling from my cheeksalso the tastes is awful</td><td>List(i, used, this, product, to, help, me, fight, bad, breath, and, control, tartar, and, even, fight, gingivitiswell, to, my, disappointment, this, has, actually, made, my, mouth, worse, and, created, a, new, problem, white, film, is, peeling, from, my, cheeksalso, the, tastes, is, awful)</td><td>List(used, product, help, fight, bad, breath, control, tartar, even, fight, gingivitiswell, disappointment, actually, made, mouth, worse, created, new, problem, white, film, peeling, cheeksalso, tastes, awful)</td><td>List(0, 544, List(5, 18, 20, 31, 40, 103, 134, 147, 222, 329, 409), List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>After many tries this item would only work about 1 in 5 tries.

Now, I had enjoyed this the first time I viewed it (holy cow, can it really be 15 years ago? I'm feeling old...), but I'm well aware that it's long been fashionable in some circles to make fun of the film. But you know, I don't think it really deserves it.Oh, there's no doubt the star of the film is the ship; the screenplay itself is less than stellar. It's a bit hokey and clunky and heavy-handed, with no real subtlety or originality. But in one sense, these attributes actually work well with a story set in this era; the simple plot (with a broad portrayal of both good and evil characters) is presented in a fashion similar to how a melodrama would have been depicted back in 1912, whether on-stage or in the earliest short silent films. I found myself thinking that the script really wasn't nearly as bad as many people have made it out to be, over the intervening years since the film was first released.That said, I'm afraid that the film didn't really \"grab\" me as much this time around, as it had when I first saw it when I was a good deal younger. Maybe I'm just getting old and tired and cynical? Or, perhaps it's the fact that I'm not a big fan of any of the actors in the film, and have no interest whatsoever in the two playing the leads. I think if the film featured some acting talent about whom I was enthusiastic, who I was excited to see on the screen, I would have found the film to be considerably more riveting. As it is---eh, I'm not all that thrilled with any of the characters apart from Molly Brown, who I thought was a lot of fun in every one of her too-brief scenes.Hmmm, what can I say---I still enjoy the picture (though it's not one that I'm likely to re-watch often in its entirety) and I do recommend it. However---any film with a running time of over three hours needs to have an intermission! Sitting still that long is too hard on the butt---heh.The 3D conversion was nicely done, but not exceptional. I thought it would be a little more striking, in fact---after the first hour I kind of forgot that I was even seeing it in 3D. But, no real complaints on this score.This re-release may not set any box-office records, but after only a week in theatres it's already easily paid for the 3D conversion process and is making a tidy profit.---SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING---Oh, I do have one huge complaint---and there's probably no need to even post spoiler warnings, because doesn't everyone already know exactly what happens at the end? While I find the very end of the film most touching---haunting, even---the bit that comes before that annoys the heck out of me. I STILL am ticked off that \"old Rose\" threw the priceless blue diamond into the water! I don't care how symbolic it is---explain it any way you like, that was just a stupid and pointless and senseless thing to do to an art object that had huge historical significance. Holy cow, she could have just written out a complete account of her story and packed it up along with the gem---and then upon her death made sure her will specified that the package was delivered to the Smithsonian, or something like that. Man---even writing out these words, and I find I'm getting ticked off all over again! So, that's the one thing that I really hate about this film.Well, now that I'm thinking about the ship, I'm curious to view both the 1950's version ofTitanic(starring Barbara Stanwyck) andA Night to Remember (Criterion Collection)(also from the 1950's). I've seen both films, but it's been a while and I don't have a clear recollection of either...</td><td>List(what, with, the, 100th, anniversary, of, the, sinking, of, the, titanic, coming, up, in, a,

The film was originally scheduled for a 2002 release but it suffered from production and serious financial problems -- the company went bankrupt during post-production. I'm guessing they HAD to slap together something and get it released to make enough money just to pay off all the lawyers.The \"cheesy\" CGI was of the quality found in big-budget TV sci-fi shows of that time (like Star Trek Voyager). The post-production team probably could not afford to buy high-end \"Jurassic Park\" type CGI for a B-movie. The CGI renditions they used are passable on a TV-size screen but come off as absolutely horrid on a 40 foot screen. I suspect this is why much of the film was shot in low-light environments -- don't have to show as much detail.As noted by many, the film also suffered from terrible scripting; don't blame the actors, they have to work with what's placed in front of them.Remember, the movie was based on a Ray Bradbury sci-fi short story written in the 1950's -- long before much was known about how dinosaurs became extinct, or the fact that the Earth suffered numerous mass-extinctions throughout its history. The whole \"butterfly effect\" is absurdly ridiculous especially given the fact the plot has a pyroclastic flow from an erupting volcano wiping out all the local life anyway. Nor can we ignore the giant comet / meteor that wiped out some 90% of all life on the planet 65-million years ago (that probably was not known as a scientific fact when Bradbury wrote the story).Did it ever occur to anyone that maybe the butterfly was SUPPOSED to die and that the \"time-wave\" events depicted in the movie ,in fact, showed the correct version of evolution? Maybe it was Homo Sapiens (and all other primates) who shouldn't be here today? Maybe it was the highly-evolved simian-reptiles who actually made the first journey back to the Jurassic tar-pit and THEY were the ones who screwed everything up in the first place?Never the less, I gave the movie a charitable 3-star rating. Suitable for kids cooped up in the house on a rainy Saturday afternoon or a dorm room beer party. Cheap entertainment, just avoid thinking while viewing and you'll be o.k.

I first tried Nizoral 1% shampoo but it did nothing for me.  Then I tried Neutrogena T-Gel and it didn't do enough.  T-Sal is the strongest medicinal shampoo you can buy for scalp dermatitis that I know of.  You must use a lot of the shampoo and lather it up and leave it on your scalp for at least 5 minutes for maximum benefit.  Also do not forget to also use the shampoo around your ears, your neck and your forehead as the skin there may also be affected by the dermatitis.  I bought the 5 bottle package and I have already used the first bottle in little over a month.  I plan to continue to use this shampoo as I have noticed an improvement in my scalp problems.

I settled on the X-E1 over the X-M1 for the viewfinder and not the X-Pro1 due to size and cost.This camera is the most pleasant to operate of any camera I have seen since cameras went digital. You want to set Aperture? Roll the ring on the lens, just like you did with a film camera. Shutter speed? Dial on top again like a film camera. There are no 'Mode' dials anywhere to be found, on 'Sports, Mountain, Birthday cake settings' . just plain simple controls. If you want the shutter speed to be automatic, set it to A, same with Aperture.If you want more, there are tons of options in the menu system, but most photo enthusiasts will just ignore these.The image sensor is fantastic, providing image quality on par with the very best DSLR's out there, even full frame. Within 30 minutes of owning the X-E1, I took the best pictures I ever have, and even more important my wife was able to reproduce the same results. A lot of this was also due to the 35mm f1.4 lens, but the simplicity of the camera and it's high quality sensor round out the picture.The build quality is top notch, with all the dials and buttons having great feel and positive feedback.The owners manual is a bit small so I downloaded the .pdf from Fuji's web site and loaded it into iBooks, now I just read it on the iPad, so size problem solved.This will be, I believe, my camera of choice for many years to come.</td><td>List(i, have, not, had, a, good, camera, since, my, early, 20, s, when, i, managed, to, lose, my, canon, ae, 1, with, several, lenses, flash, etc, in, jamaica, life, and, kids, has, regulated, me, to, digital, cameras, of, the, point, and, shoot, variety, until, now, i, did, tons, of, research, online, consulted, with, several, photography, types, and, came, up, with, the, fujifilm, x, series, i, settled, on, the, x, e1, over, the, x, m1, for, the, viewfinder, and, not, the, x, pro1, due, to, size, and, cost, this, camera, is, the, most, pleasant, to, operate, of, any, camera, i, have, seen, since, cameras, went, digital, you, want, to, set, aperture, roll, the, ring, on, the, lens, just, like, you, did, with, a, film, camera, shutter, speed, dial, on, top, again, like, a, film, camera, there, are, no, mode, dials, anywhere, to, be, found, on, sports, mountain, birthday, cake, settings, just, plain, simple, controls, if, you, want, the, shutter, speed, to, be, automatic, set, it, to, a, same, with, aperture, if, you, want, more, there, are, tons, of, options, in, the, menu, system, but, most, photo, enthusiasts, will, just, ignore, these, the, image, sensor, is, fantastic, providing, image, quality, on, par, with, the, very, best, dslr, s, out, there, even, full, frame, within, 30, minutes, of, owning, the, x, e1, i, took, the, best, pictures, i, ever, have, and, even, more, important, my, wife, was, able, to, reproduce, the, same, results, a, lot, of, this, was, also, due, to, the, 35mm, f1, 4, lens, but, the, simplicity, of, the, camera, and, it, s, high, quality, sensor, round, out, the, picture, the, build, quality, is, top, notch, with, all, the, dials, and, buttons, having, great, feel, and, positive, feedback, the, owners, manual, is, a, bit, small, so, i, downloaded, the, pdf, from, fuji, s, web, site, and, loaded, it, into, ibooks, now, i, just, read, it, on, the, ipad, so, size, problem, solved, this, will, be, i, believe, my, camera, of, choice, for, many, years, to, come)</td><td>List(good, camera, since, early, 20, managed, lose, canon, ae, 1, several, lenses, flash, etc, jamaica, life, kids, regulated, digital, cameras, point, shoot, variety, tons, research, online, consulted, several, photography, types, came, fujifilm, x, series, settled, x, e1, x, m1, viewfinder, x, pro1, due, size, cost, camera, pleasant, operate, camera, seen, since, cameras, went, digital, want, set, aperture, roll, ring, lens, like, film, camera, shutter, speed, dial, top, like, film, camera, mode, dials, anywhere, found, sports, mountain, birthday, cake, settings, plain, simple, controls, want, shutter, speed, automatic, set, aperture, want, tons, options, menu, system, photo, enthusiasts, ignore, image, sensor, fantastic, providing, image, quality, par, best, dslr, even, full, frame, within, 30, minutes, owning, x, e1, took, best, pictures, ever, even, important, wife, able, reproduce, results, lot, also, due, 35mm, f1, 4, lens, simplicity, camera, high, quality, sensor, round, picture, build, quality, top, notch, dials, buttons, great, feel, positive, feedback, owners, manual, bit, small, downloaded, pdf, fuji, web, site, loaded, ibooks, read, ipad, size, problem, solved, believe, camera, choice, many, years, come)</td><td>List(0, 544, List(1, 2, 3, 14, 20, 24, 45, 47, 53, 55, 57, 62, 69, 71, 74, 75, 80, 87, 91, 97, 103, 115, 119, 123, 131, 136, 139, 145, 172, 182, 195, 200, 201, 219, 236, 237, 248, 291, 309, 316, 319, 342, 354, 375, 380, 385, 414, 421, 438, 478, 534), List(1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 7.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0))</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>You never really appreciate these things until you try them.

Enjoying even the great special effects of this film isn't enough to make for a really memorable sci-fi experience as it takes an engaging plot to make a good film, even in science-fiction.I don't believe anyone would think of this movie as part of the Alien series or try to compare it with prior Alien films. It obviously represents a \"knock off\" intended to attract from a large number of satisfied customers of the Alien vs Predator magazines. This doesn't mean that it shouldn't be considered good sci-fi film and I purchased the DVD hoping for a satisfying film experience.The story line does a nice job of connecting the film histories of the Alien and Predator races together and linking these two fictional accounts with the history of man on earth in a plausible way. Most people agree that the history of ancient monuments all over the earth appear to have a common link, which is probably one of the sources of the Atlantis myth.If anything I think AVP attempted to recapture the action and line up of good characters from ALIENS. Also, rather than the one-on-one bug hunt of the original film, this movie was about war between a defacto army of humans against an army of Alien creatures and their very dangerous Queen.In terms of special effects I would give this movie four stars, however, I couldn't get all that interested in the basic story and AVP left me with an overall one to two star impression and the feeling I was watching an animated comic book.I must admit that I never had the large screen theater experience and first saw the film on DVD at home. I assumed I would at least like AVP since I own the entire Alien series on DVD and enjoy seeing every one of them over and over again.

It's got it ALL, baby.Let's start with Rob Lowe. Jerry McGuire he ain't. You're never going to see Rob with tears streaming down his cheeks, telling a woman that she \"completes\" him. Rather, you're more likely to find him yanking his clothes out of the closet, pulling out any photos that include him, stuffing it all in a duffel bag and hurling it into a garbage truck as he leaves the former object of his desire alone and naked in bed...just like the opening minutes of \"Bad Influence.\"And yes, I know Rob has taken some \"serious\" roles and has played the \"good guy\" on occasion, but my challenge to you is \"NAME one of those roles.\" I remembered them at the time, and I've forgotten them, pretty much like every other Rob Lowe fan on the planet. We want Evil Rob, and this movie is Pure Evil Rob.I won't offer any spoilers here, but let's just say that if you can't see the major plot twist coming from a mile away, you haven't seen too many movies.James Spader seems like an odd choice to play Lowe's \"good\" doppelganger, the guy who becomes corrupted as Rob introduces him to his own wants and desires. Spader's starred in more than his fair share of \"this guy makes me feel kind of squirmy\" roles. Of course, the only way the corruption of the character's \"innocence\" can appear real is that if it's built on shaky foundations to begin with, and Spader nails it. His character is a \"career guy,\" a \"ladder climber,\" engaged to Marcia Cross, who equally nails the boring, white bread, \"why am I marrying this woman\" object of Spader's luke-warm desire. See, Spader really doesn't want the pot of gold at the end of his rainbow. He wants to ride around in  sporty little car with Evil Rob Lowe and do evil things. And he does. Why do you think the movie is named \"Bad Influence\" instead of \"Two Nice Guys Helping Others?\"The soundtrack is lip-smackin' 80s dee-licious, too. Lots of synthy angst...a highlight being The Nymphs performing \"The Highway\" during Lowe and Spader's first venture into one of the sleazy \"password at the door\" clubs. According to the notes on the YouTube clip of this scene, \"Inger Lorre wrote this song about Richard Ramirez, the \"Night Stalker,\" and the groupies he attracted during his trial.\" Makes it a perfect choice for this movie.I could go on...in detail...but I'm keeping my \"no spoilers\" promise. You probably have a general idea of what this one is all about, and I've tried to convey the flavor without ruining the experience. I love it, I've watched it at least 100 times since its release...it's a \"midnight movie,\" it's sublime junk, it's a career high for Lowe. He plays his character with such oily, unrepentant glee that you envy anyone having that much fun and getting paid for it.

I have never seen a shrimp be able to eat one before all the guppies hoover the little pellets up. The pellets/pieces are medium sized... a bit too big for fry under 2-3 weeks old.The container label lists the ingredients as: \"Fish meal, krill, corn meal, squid meal, wheat flour, earthworm meal, dried spirulina algae, wheat gluten meal, dried seaweed meal, dried yeast, squid liver meal, dicalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, dried mango...\" it goes on for awhile. I'm not entirely happy about seeing so much grain in the food mix. The container also says to feed as much in a day as the shrimp can eat in 2 hours.The expiration date is for 6/14. Being that I bought this about two months ago, it has roughly a 2 year shelf life. Good enough.All in all, I might not buy this again.

Feed furby by putting your finger in his mouth and pushing on his tongue or you can feed him with the furby app.It is best to put rechargeable batteries in furby because he uses them quickly.All furbys are for ages 5 years and up. But some furbys might be better for younger children as furbys are all different colours and textures. For example, a white furby might be better for a young child and a black one for an older child because white furbys have longer fur and also they look a little different than black furbys.Furbys can change their personality suddenly.

Every once in a while, when the itch to \"live large\" needs a scratch, hey, get the band back together and hit the road for another \"greatest hits\" tour, supporting another \"greatest hits\" album.Well, all was fine and good until digital media upset the Apple cart. Now with the kids sharing their Bit-Torrent files across the web in their iTunes programs, nobody's selling units anymore. And every pimply teen with an iPad has every greatest hits compilation you could ever make. Now the only time the gravy train rolls into the station for elderly and burned out artists is a new tour. Watching these codgers drag themselves across the stage at your local highly-flammible nightclub borders on the inhumane. Instead of treasuring the music of your childhood, now you have to see it fumbled out from the arthritic fingers of your idols of yesteryear.This is all to give a little background to the sad story of REM and their latest merchandising play. While branching out like this is an ingenious way to avoid leaving the house (getting prescription refills for your hypertension and high cholesterol is such a pain on tour! And forget about dealing with the insurance coverage), I have to say that branding a nose hair remover with the previously solid \"Alternative\" brand of REM might have been a mis-step.

While some newer cars have something like this built in, it's great for older cars and would be ideal for an RV or trailer to prevent any issues on a long trip. The car on which I've used the system has steel valve stems, so I haven't had any issues with losing air pressure or damage to the valves.The thing I liked the least was the installation. There is no way I could have figured out how to install the system from the documentation supplied. I had to get help from someone who is very familiar with the set up of electronics, such as navigation systems, and even he had to muddle through to figure out how to complete the set up due to the poor documentation. One issue we had is that one of the tires we wanted to monitor was already low in pressure and the system wouldn't pick that tire up during the set up.I like the design of the system itself. The monitor can be closed while driving, and then the driver only needs to worry about it if the green light changes to yellow or red. When the car is stopped, the screen can be reviewed to view the details on whatever problem is being detected. In addition, the monitor will sound an alarm for any of the \"red\" warnings.I have found it to be a useful system and would definitely find it useful for an RV or if hauling a trailer.

I'm not an audiophile and don't have a Technics 1200 to compare it to, but I do have ears and eyes and hands.  First of all, this unit looks good.  I may be biased because I've wanted a new turntable for over a year and I chose the AT-LP120 very early on in my research, but it does look nice.  I have a couple of friends that DO have the 1200MK2, and they like this turntable.  One of them purchased a 120 to use every day and... because it has the USB out.  He calls it a 1200 clone.  Second, if you pick it up, you'll feel the substantial weight which undoubtably lends to it's steadiness and (so far) unwaivering spin rate.  My old turntable, a Technic SA-202 I've had since 1982, has served me well and still serves as the party starter in the garage (next to the bar and milk crates full of records).  Had to move it down there when the other TT crapped out over 5 years ago, so you can see I really needed a new living room unit.  And of course sound wise, the new AT-LP120 does not dissapoint.  But again, maybe my opinion is biased, because I just love to play an album.  I like sliding out the liner, then the record, smell of the vinyl, slight static that raises the hair on my arms, using the discwasher, then placing the arm manually and hearing that &#34;thump&#34; as the needle settles into the groove.  Then sitting back and listening to a whole side, where I'm not clamoring to find a new song or jumping ahead with a touch screen &#34;click&#34;, is much more enjoyable. You could buy this turntable because it's a good deal, really, for what I paid for the 202 in 1982 (just over $200) you can have a greatly superior model.

A burnt out junkie who is closer to the end of his career than the beginning seems to fit him perfectly.This movie is a heist movie to begin with, and director Neil Jordan shoots it with the appropriate glitz and glamour that a film set in Monte Carlo deserves. He nails the atmosphere, giving the movie a dark, jazzy feel, mixing the styles of the classic films noir and the new reinvention of the style. The plot is good, as it is filled with twists and turns, as any good heist flick should. One thing that should be mentioned is the chemistry between all the characters. The cast is completely European, save Nolte, yet they mesh incredibly well together. The relationship between Bob and Roger the police officer is one of the movie's centerpieces, and their mutual respect and odd friendship is completely believable without too much explanation. Also good in this movie is the girl who plays Anna, and I won't even attempt to spell her name, because it could take up to an hour to get it right. She is as throaty as she is innocent, yet there is an obvious dark side to her character, one that often shines brighter than the innocence of a seventeen year old runaway.Aside from the crime side of the movie, &quot;The Good Thief&quot; is about rebirth, in all of the characters. They are all ressurecting themselves from their past lives, trying to make good on the lives that still lay ahead of them. All in all, this is a good movie, and should entertain most people who are into this genre until the exciting end.</td><td>List(i, am, not, afraid, to, admit, that, i, think, nick, nolte, is, one, of, the, most, overrated, actors, of, his, generation, but, i, think, that, he, was, really, good, in, quot, the, good, thief, quot, because, he, was, playing, someone, so, close, to, himself, in, real, life, a, burnt, out, junkie, who, is, closer, to, the, end, of, his, career, than, the, beginning, seems, to, fit, him, perfectly, this, movie, is, a, heist, movie, to, begin, with, and, director, neil, jordan, shoots, it, with, the, appropriate, glitz, and, glamour, that, a, film, set, in, monte, carlo, deserves, he, nails, the, atmosphere, giving, the, movie, a, dark, jazzy, feel, mixing, the, styles, of, the, classic, films, noir, and, the, new, reinvention, of, the, style, the, plot, is, good, as, it, is, filled, with, twists, and, turns, as, any, good, heist, flick, should, one, thing, that, should, be, mentioned, is, the, chemistry, between, all, the, characters, the, cast, is, completely, european, save, nolte, yet, they, mesh, incredibly, well, together, the, relationship, between, bob, and, roger, the, police, officer, is, one, of, the, movie, s, centerpieces, and, their, mutual, respect, and, odd, friendship, is, completely, believable, without, too, much, explanation, also, good, in, this, movie, is, the, girl, who, plays, anna, and, i, won, t, even, attempt, to, spell, her, name, because, it, could, take, up, to, an, hour, to, get, it, right, she, is, as, throaty, as, she, is, innocent, yet, there, is, an, obvious, dark, side, to, her, character, one, that, often, shines, brighter, than, the, innocence, of, a, seventeen, year, old, runaway, aside, from, the, crime, side, of, the, movie, quot, the, good, thief, quot, is, about, rebirth, in, all, of, the, characters, they, are, all, ressurecting, themselves, from, their, past, lives, trying, to, make, good, on, the, lives, that, still, lay, ahead, of, them, all, in, all, this, is, a, good, movie, and, should, entertain, most, people, who, are, into, this, genre, until, the, exciting, end)</td><td>List(afraid, admit, think, nick, nolte, one, overrated, actors, generation, think, really, good, quot, good, thief, quot, playing, someone, close, real, life, burnt, junkie, closer, end, career, beginning, seems, fit, perfectly, movie, heist, movie, begin, director, neil, jordan, shoots, appropriate, glitz, glamour, film, set, monte, carlo, deserves, nails, atmosphere, giving, movie, dark, jazzy, feel, mixing, styles, classic, films, noir, new, reinvention, style, plot, good, filled, twists, turns, good, heist, flick, one, thing, mentioned, chemistry, characters, cast, completely, european, save, nolte, yet, mesh, incredibly, well, together, relationship, bob, roger, police, officer, one, movie, centerpieces, mutual, respect, odd, friendship, completely, believable, without, much, explanation, also, good, movie, girl, plays, anna, won, even, attempt, spell, name, take, hour, get, right, throaty, innocent, yet, obvious, dark, side, character, one, often, shines, brighter, innocence, seventeen, year, old, runaway, aside, crime, side, movie, quot, good, thief, quot, rebirth, characters, ressurecting, past, lives, trying, make, good, lives, still, lay, ahead, good, movie, entertain, people, genre, exciting, end)</td><td>List(0, 544, List(0, 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 20, 34, 37, 40, 43, 50, 53, 58, 63, 64, 76, 78, 83, 115, 121, 138, 144, 150, 170, 174, 180, 181, 209, 237, 274, 298, 340, 401, 407, 418, 461, 471, 486, 499, 500), List(4.0, 8.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 7.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0))</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>I am using this on my new sirius satellite radio, and I got what I was expecting and works great!!!</td><td>List(i, am, using, this, on, my, new, sirius, satellite, radio, and, i, got, what, i, was, expecting, and, works, great)</td><td>List(using, new, sirius, satellite, radio, got, expecting, works, great)</td><td>List(0, 544, List(1, 17, 28, 30, 40), List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This carafe has been a great addition to my home.

It only rises a little bit and instead of cutting it in two I made one large 16&#34; pizza. Just make sure to spray down your pizza pan with pam or similar type spray and get a bowl of warm water to keep your hands wet so the dough is easier to work with.

The only way to tame these was to change EQ on the ipod for \"small speakers\" which sort of flattens the sound out and reduces the treble as much as possible.

I have numerous only IDE drives and need to be able to get to old backup files. The Seagate drives I have worked perfectly, while the one Maxtor drive didn't work at all. The Maxtor drive has a wider jumper pin bay between the power plug and the data cable. So it would not insert into the device.  Fortunately I mainly have Seagate drives so that is not a big issue.  I don't have any SATA drives lying around to try it on so I have no idea how good that is. It is so convenient being able to insert a drive and go, that I have decided to use it to do my system backups to harddrives instead of to tape.  Some reviews say that have had problems getting the system to recognize the drive after inserting.  This has not been a problem for me.  It behaves much the same way as a thumb drive does.  The only difference I have really notices is in the drive letter selection. Unlike a thumb drive the hard drive apparently gets a higher priority in the drive letter selection.  So when it is inserted any thumb drive you have inserted into the same device will get shuffled downward and its letter will be given to the new harddrive.  The Eject option is also not available, like it is for other external media.  But the drive can still be disconnected in the USB taskbar tool just like any other drive, so there is no risk in losing data with incomplete data writes.I recommend this device.

I could hear (click, click) the hard drive head flying all over the disk trying to find data.  I was fortunate to get one last Time Machine backup with the help of placing cold compresses above and below my HD to cool it down (old freeze hard drive recovery trick).  I ordered one day service and got it FedEx on a Saturday! YES! Thanks Amazon!  Received in a padded envelope.  Not a big deal since the SSD is light and more shockproof than regular hard drive.  Additionally, the box allows for reasonable cushion as well.  Good that minimal packaging was used.  I hate when packaging is unnecessarily 10 times bigger than the actual product.  Such waste!  From there it was a reformat and restore from Time Machine.  Everything went well and operated like any other HD.My choice to go to SSD was not very deeply researched.  I knew SSD have been around for a while and I knew of the performance and durability it provides.  I know that the ruggedized laptops at work were running SSD.  If those guys are using them in rough conditions then it should be ok.  Since I believe heat was the reason my original drive went, I decided to just go for SSD because of durability reasons.  I knew it was supposed to be faster but didn't know what to expect.  I wasn't paying attention to load times before so I wasn't very impressed initially.  I then used a friend's laptop with similar specs and saw the difference.  The startup and program load up time are definitely shorter.  It just seems like the programs are on the starting line waiting for your click to sprint to the finish line of loading the program.  I did notice the laptop seems to run cooler.  I do photo editing and I did a test to export a set of pictures.  I didn't measure times but I believe time was cut in half.  So far everything is running well!  Some are worried about degraded performance but I think by that time it would be time to get another SSD anyway.  However, I will be mindful of my SSD usage as I say that... haha!I am glad I spent the extra money to get the SSD.</td><td>List(the, hd, on, my, mid, 2010, 15, macbook, pro, was, going, out, i, could,

There is one small negative though...I started playing RB again after a 15-year layoff, but liability issues  (and common sense) now require eyewear at every gym. I generally don't like this kind of thing, but I'm willing to to accommodate gym rules in order to play such a crazy great game (should be an olympic sport).My first eyewear was given to me by a friend, and I knew after a five-game series that this would be my first RB purchase (before a better racquet, etc.). The eyewear he gave me fogged and was blurry... I couldn't really even play and wanted to just take the damn things off (but couldn't). It was like playing with blinders.So I read up on RB eyewear and decided on these... it's been nine months of heavy-duty play (we play 90-120 minutes for 5-7 games three times a week... there is no dry material on my body at the end of the matches). These have been awesome... crystal clear focus (I normally wear glasses but not for RB), no fog ever (I sweat heavily), no scratches (I wash them before every series and dry them on whatever I have handy). They have adjustable length earpieces and a hearty closed-cell foam band across the entire length of the frame (keeps sweat from running into your eyes).The only negative is that there are cracks in the lens... several small ones that emanate from the nose piece... but they haven't spread and they don't interfere in play at all...

Otherwise Christmas Day is spent running around trying to figure out crazy toys like this one. I have had a hard time with toys before, but this one definitely ranks near the top.First I put in batteries and turn the switch to on. Nothing happens. I put in newly charged batteries, nothing happens. I put in brand new duracells, nothing happens. This might sounds straightforward, but putting batteries in this thing is nothing of the sort. I wondered why there was two screws on the battery lid instead of the normal one on most toys. Its because the force required to press and keep the lid down is like trying to close a suitcase that has two times too many clothes in it. Absurd!Finally, like some others here, I hooked it up to the computer thinking maybe it needed to 'activate' or some such nonsense. The thing turned right on!!! At least it wasn't broken, I thought. After transferring some mp3s, I read the instruction manual thinking maybe there was a trick.The instruction manual was completely USELESS. It had a small diagram of the unit and told how to plug in the USB cable and that's it.I unplugged from the computer and turned the unit on. Nothing. I thought maybe it takes a while to boot up. So I waited a bit. Nothing. Out of frustration I hit the play button thinking that might be the key, voila!! It turned on!!!That's right, on a toy so simply made you could potentially give it to your 2 year old, they make the prerequisite for playing songs, the holding down of the green button after the switch is turned on. So what looks deceptively like the perfect toddler toy is actually a monster of complexity in disguise with a feature that completely kills the ease of use otherwise. However, even 2 year olds are pretty smart with electronics, I'm sure she'll figure it out.Another tip, but if you press and hold the green button while the unit is on, it will shutdown. That's right, press the Green ON button to shutdown!!!I'm reluctant to give this more than two stars because its extremely unlikely that more than 20% of the people who buy this thing will figure out all of the above. I feel sorry for the folks who think the only way to turn this thing on is to plug it into the computer. However, I'm going to go with three, because once I figured all of this out, I know my 2 year old is going to love it, and it will make my wife happy that she's not putting CDs in her boombox and playing music that way anymore.</td><td>List(i, have, never, used, such, an, obtuse, kids, toy, especially, one, that, is, targeted, at, 3, 4, year, olds, after, a, few, christmas, s, with, 2, 5,

I still had hair left on my other side so I could pretty much do a comb over to conceal this catastrophe.

I did not take notice of the time, but it could not have been more than about 25 minutes to steam/clean our large kitchen/hallway areas.  Solution provided by Hoover smells nice and, along with using the steam, did a great job. I will research where I can purchase the solution for less, or just use something else.  Can also use just vinegar solution (advice given by installer of the stone floor in our kitchen).  With vinegar solution, I would choose to have machine do continuous steam cycle.Where extra steam was needed, I pressed the steam lever (lever was comfortable to use, did not cause pain in my arthritic thumb).I had researched several steam moppers, and had considered the Haan, but I am glad that I saw the Hoover and its reviews.  I am happy with my purchase, and the fact that the pads are priced fairly.It was easy to wash the used pad, and I did it by hand, squeezed well, then line dried in my laundry room.Con:  The 2 canisters were a bit difficult for me to take off the steamer, but I have arthritic hands.  I was able to do it by stepping on mop base, leaning the stick against me, then grasping the canister with both hands.  If you do not issues with your hands, you should not experience difficulty.Overall, I am glad that I made this purchase.  Having owned a Shark which always left my floors not as clean as I wanted, this choice is wins hands-down.  The Shark \"died\" several weeks ago and was put in our town's bulk pick-up.  Our local Home-Depot had a ridiculously low price on this model, and S/H was free, however I chose to have the item shipped to the store where I was able to pick it up.

Why not? Because this truck has a very vulnerable Achilles Tendon that kills the fun.First, the good:  This truck is a very solid performer, easily able to stand against Traxxas's 4WD Stampede.  This truck is actually more user friendly than the 'pede thanks to it's AVC feature.  Turning this feature up stabilizes the truck, at the cost of slight performance reduction.  To share a personal experience about it, I drive this truck with the AVC turned off for maximum performance.  My sister's boyfriend came and watched me drive it.  He had never driven a hobby grade RC, and was very timid when I handed him the transmitter.  He felt the truck was too much for him, so I turned on the AVC.  With the AVC, he quickly gained confidence and had a blast driving it.Now....that Achilles tendon.......is the four drive shafts from the differentials to the wheels.  Vaterra decided to forego traditional dogbone style shafts, and went with telescoping drive shafts.  Plastic drive shafts.  Brittle plastic drive shafts that break easily, even when puttering around on flat ground.  Horizon Hobby has been wonderful about replacing them for me, but I don't like working on the truck every time or every other time I drive it!  A CVD system for this truck is in the works, and I fervently hope that this rectifies this issue.So..... I will happily recommend this truck IF you don't mind constantly replacing driveshafts while you wait for the CVD replacement system to be released,  as this truck truly is a blast to drive for botn beginners and experienced drivers.  If you don't want to deal with the drive shafts, then I suggest watching and waiting for improvements to be made to the drive train.</td><td>List(this, truck, is, awesome, and, i, very, badly, want, to, give, it, five, stars, why, not, because, this, truck, has, a, very, vulnerable, achilles, tendon, that, kills, the, fun, first, the, good, this, truck, is, a, very, solid, performer, easily, able, to, stand, against, traxxas, s, 4wd, stampede, this, truck, is, actually, more, user, friendly, than, the, pede, thanks, to, it, s, avc, feature, turning, this, feature, up, stabilizes, the, truck, at, the, cost, of, slight, performance, reduction, to, share, a, personal, experience, about, it, i, drive, this, truck, with, the, avc, turned, off, for, maximum, performance, my, sister, s, boyfriend, came, and, watched, me, drive, it, he, had, never, driven, a, hobby, grade, rc, and, was, very, timid, when, i, handed, him, the, transmitter, he, felt, the, truck, was, too, much, for, him, so, i, turned, on, the, avc, with, the, avc, he, quickly, gained, confidence, and, had, a, blast, driving, it, now, that, achilles, tendon, is, the, four, drive, shafts, from, the, differentials, to, the, wheels, vaterra, decided, to, forego, traditional, dogbone, style, shafts, and, went, with, telescoping, drive, shafts, plastic, drive, shafts, brittle, plastic, drive, shafts, that, break, easily, even, when, puttering, around, on, flat, ground, horizon, hobby, has, been, wonderful, about, replacing, them, for, me, but, i, don, t, like, working, on, the, truck, every, time, or, every, other, time, i, drive, it, a, cvd, system, for, this, truck, is, in, the, works, and, i, fervently, hope, that, this, rectifies, this, issue, so, i, will, happily, recommend, this, truck, if, you, don, t, mind, constantly, replacing, driveshafts, while, you, wait, for, the, cvd, replacement, system, to, be, released, as, this, truck, truly, is, a, blast, to, drive, for, botn, beginners, and, experienced, drivers, if, you, don, t, want, to, deal, with, the, drive, shafts, then, i, suggest, watching, and, waiting, for, improvements, to, be, made, to, the, drive, train)</td><td>List(truck, awesome, badly, want, give, five, stars, truck, vulnerable, achilles, tendon, kills, fun, first, good, truck, solid, performer, easily, able, stand, traxxas, 4wd, stampede, truck, actually, user, friendly, pede, thanks, avc, feature, turning, feature, stabilizes, truck, cost, slight, performance, reduction, share, personal, experience, drive, truck, avc, turned, maximum, performance, sister, boyfriend, came, watched, drive, never, driven, hobby, grade, rc, timid, handed, transmitter, felt, truck, much, turned, avc, avc, quickly, gained, confidence, blast, driving, achilles, tendon, four, drive, shafts, differentials, wheels, vaterra, decided, forego, traditional, dogbone, style, shafts, went, telescoping, drive, shafts, plastic, drive, shafts, brittle, plastic, drive, shafts, break, easily, even, puttering, around, flat, ground, horizon, hobby, wonderful, replacing, like, working, truck, every, time, every, time, drive, cvd, system, truck, works, fervently, hope, rectifies, issue, happily, recommend, truck, mind, constantly, replacing, driveshafts, wait, cvd, replacement, system, released, truck, truly, blast, drive, botn, beginners, experienced, drivers, want, deal, drive, shafts, suggest, watching, waiting, improvements, made, drive, train)</td><td>List(0, 544, List(2, 3, 8, 12, 17, 20, 26, 31, 32, 62, 67, 72, 77, 97, 117, 123, 126, 130, 134, 193, 201, 206, 212, 227, 253, 260, 287, 294, 307, 316, 339, 348, 354, 386, 396, 405, 406, 451, 457, 476, 480, 481, 486, 491, 497, 503), List(1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 10.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0))</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>My daughter is 5 months and loves her Sophie.

After using the Melitta cone and Clever Coffee Dripper for awhile (which are also great products), I decided to give the Hario cone another try as I wanted to get away from using plastic cones.  The Hario happens to sit perfectly on the small four cup carafe that I use. The advantages of the Hario are the porcelain construction helps to keep the coffee hotter longer, and this cone just brews a superior cup of coffee.  I can make two cups as we do not like real strong coffee (I use one level Hario scoop per 12 oz. of water - which seems to be about half the coffee others recommend); therefore, the Size 02 just holds my two scoops of coffee and after a 30 second blooming period, I stir the grounds then use the slow circular pour method with a glass Pyrex measuring cup being careful not to pour above the top of the grounds (water at 198-200 degrees).  As I have to refill the Pyrex once with a second 12 ozs. of water, it helps to keep everything nice and hot (I also cover the top of the cone and Pyrex with plastic lids to preserve heat); stir once again during the last fill. The result is two perfect mugs of coffee every time.  I haven't timed the process, but I think it takes about 5 to 6 minutes from start to finish.  I highly recommend the Hario if you want a superior cup of coffee!</td><td>List(it, took, me, awhile, and, the, use, of, some, other, manual, coffee, products, to, really, appreciate, the, hario, after, using, the, melitta, cone, and, clever, coffee, dripper, for, awhile, which, are, also, great, products, i, decided, to, give, the, hario, cone, another, try, as, i, wanted, to, get, away, from, using, plastic, cones, the, hario, happens, to, sit, perfectly, on, the, small, four, cup, carafe, that, i, use, the, advantages, of, the, hario, are, the, porcelain, construction, helps, to, keep, the, coffee, hotter, longer, and, this, cone, just, brews, a, superior, cup, of, coffee, i, can, make, two, cups, as, we, do, not, like, real, strong, coffee, i, use, one, level, hario, scoop, per, 12, oz, of, water, which, seems, to, be, about, half, the, coffee, others, recommend, therefore, the, size, 02, just, holds, my, two, scoops, of, coffee, and, after, a, 30, second, blooming, period, i, stir, the, grounds, then, use, the, slow, circular, pour, method, with, a, glass, pyrex, measuring, cup, being, careful, not, to, pour, above, the, top, of, the, grounds, water, at, 198, 200, degrees, as, i, have, to, refill, the, pyrex, once, with, a, second, 12, ozs, of, water, it, helps, to, keep, everything, nice, and, hot, i, also, cover, the, top, of, the, cone, and, pyrex, with, plastic, lids, to, preserve, heat, stir, once, again, during, the, last, fill, the, result, is, two, perfect, mugs, of, coffee, every, time, i, haven, t, timed, the, process, but, i, think, it, takes, about, 5, to, 6, minutes, from, start, to, finish, i, highly, recommend, the, hario, if, you, want, a, superior, cup, of, coffee)</td><td>List(took, awhile, use, manual, coffee, products, really, appreciate, hario, using, melitta, cone, clever, coffee, dripper, awhile, also, great, products, decided, give, hario, cone, another, try, wanted, get, away, using, plastic, cones, hario, happens, sit, perfectly, small, four, cup, carafe, use, advantages, hario, porcelain, construction, helps, keep, coffee, hotter, longer, cone, brews, superior, cup, coffee, make, two, cups, like, real, strong, coffee, use, one, level, hario, scoop, per, 12, oz, water, seems, half, coffee, others, recommend, therefore, size, 02, holds, two, scoops, coffee, 30, second, blooming, period, stir, grounds, use, slow, circular, pour, method, glass, pyrex, measuring, cup, careful, pour, top, grounds, water, 198, 200, degrees, refill, pyrex, second, 12, ozs, water, helps, keep, everything, nice, hot, also, cover, top, cone, pyrex, plastic, lids, preserve, heat, stir, last, fill, result, two, perfect, mugs, coffee, every, time, haven, timed, process, think, takes, 5, 6, minutes, start, finish, highly, recommend, hario, want, superior, cup, coffee)</td><td>List(0, 544, List(0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 14, 28, 32, 35, 36, 37, 47, 48, 54, 58, 62, 66, 73, 77, 87, 89, 95, 117, 119, 121, 125, 130, 139, 155, 163, 165, 174, 175, 178, 194, 200, 202, 205, 220, 233, 242, 255, 296, 297, 298, 301, 307, 313, 364, 385, 392, 406, 432, 434, 460, 502), List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 9.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0))</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>This is not the same as Ativa Dandelion tea.

One is a tennis player and one is a pretty creepy guy with \"big ideas\" (read: the enemy), they hit it off pretty well, but the second man turns out to get too involved with his ideas and ends up killing the tennis player's wife for him after the tennis player nonchalantly mentions he wouldn't mind having her out of the way.  Now it's a rush to see what the tennis player will do now that he's a suspect and the other man keeps appearing to urge him to kill the stalker's father, via an agreement he didn't make.So it's basically all of Hitchcock's usual fare...  a man on the run, wrongly accused; a man blackmailing him; bumbling cops; a woman who wants to figure it out but doesn't know who to trust initially before fully trusting the protagonist; and old ladies who giggle over discussions of murder.This time I don't buy it, though.  The whole lighter thing comes off as a real gimmick to me (even when the stalker guy drops it in the grate... after the initial suspense, it doesn't matter anyway 'cause he's waiting for dusk.)  I couldn't believe that there isn't some way the protagonist couldn't have gone to the police and proven that he wasn't guilty, if anything because of the two characters they were.  The drunken professor was a useless side-note.  This movie is all of Hitchcock's stuff, but none of his experimentation which is really the stuff I like.In all, this is the most suspensful of his movies, but I can't gather up the energy to care for it.  Once again, I have an issue with the characters.  I'm just so used to Hitchcock telling me the same story over and over again that frankly I'm beginning to feel like he's repeating himself.  The guy had a few recurring themes, sure, but this is starting to fall into merely obsessive pondering of the many different ways to present the same internal fear Hitchcock has of being wrongfully imprisoned.  And with each movie of his I see, instead of said fear making me feel like I'm seeing some auteur at work, I'm beginning to see a guy who needs to relax a little.  I like his much more experimental stuff, where he plays with camera and imagery and narrative and design.  This \"suspense thriller\" stuff with the typical motifs is getting very dull, which is a terrible thing.--PolarisDiB</td><td>List(two, men, strangers, meet, on, a, train, as, per, the, title, one,

I was so impressed with it that I immediately went out and bought two of them.  I wound up giving the extra one I purchased to a friend who also loves it. Therefore, when this T-fal came up for review, I wanted to see how it compared to my Cuisinart.After using this machine a couple of times, I would have rated this T-fal 3-1/2 to 4 stars had I not already owned the Cuisinart.  However, because I am use to such an exceptional ice cream maker, I find this one just okay, so that is why it gets a plain three star-rating from me.PROS- It makes one quart of good ice cream (my Cuisinart makes two quarts)- I made both the strawberry ice cream and the lemon sorbet. The ice cream was good. The lemon sorbet came out excellent; although I was surprised the recipe did not call for heating the egg white.  (My Cuisinart recipe uses water instead of egg white.)- I consider the currently listed price of $34.99 reasonable and it's less than half the price of the Cuisinart I purchased.- This machine is quieter than my Cuisinart.CONS- The ice cream recipes are not exceptional.  Although my strawberry ice cream came out good, it was not as creamy or sweet as the recipe that came with my Cuisinart and it tasted icy or more like sorbet. The recipes that came with my Cuisinart are outstanding and a bit more flavorful and probably more calories too.  For instance, the T-fal strawberry ice cream recipe calls for strawberries, powdered sugar, lemon, and heavy cream.  My Cuisinart recipe also includes adding whole milk and vanilla extract and it uses regular sugar instead of powdered and calls for about  more sugar than the T-fal recipe. I did not mark it down for this because this has nothing to do with the ice cream maker itself and recipe books can always be purchased.- The chute on the cover is a little too small so it is not as easy to pour in the ingredients without messing up the top.- Assembling and disassembling the unit is \"sticky\" and tricky.  I had trouble removing the freezer bowl from the base because there is no grip when pulling straight up.  Even lining up the top and locking that in place was cumbersome; although after several tries I have that down well.  The paddle also requires a good push to get it into the motor but now seats easily.- The instructions for cleaning are not adequate.  There are actually 6 parts to this ice cream maker (as opposed to the 5 parts shown in the instructions).  My Cuisinart only has 4 parts.  In order to clean everything but the motor, I had to dissemble all parts. Getting the bowl out of the base is the most difficult.  However, I had to dissemble the lid after making ice cream because the ice cream got stuck in the crevices of the top.  I did not have to do this after the sorbet.  The lid coms apart easily as long as I flexed it when I pulled it away from the nubs holding it in place.- In my opinion, the bowl takes up an odd amount of space in my freezer compared to my Cuisinart. My Cuisinart 2-QT bowl is totally cylindrical and measures 7-3/4 inches wide by 6-3/4 inches tall.  This T-fal 1-QT bowl is flared at the top and measures 5-1/2 inches wide at the very bottom to about 9-1/2 wide at the top due to the handles.  It also measures 6-1/2 inches tall.No matter what machine one chooses, making ice cream is messy and requires prior preparation because of the cooking instructions and the fact that time is needed in the freezer for the ice cream to harden. Also making ice cream usually costs more than buying the pre-made product. The joy I get from making my own home-made product, however, far outweighs these caveats.In summary, although I cannot attest to the longevity of this machine, I think this is a decent ice cream maker for making small quantities of ice cream.  Had I not owned a Cuisinart, I would have been more pleased with this machine.  However, the cumbersome assembly and disassembly is the main reason it is a three star machine to me.PS For those who are interested, I pasted a link to my Cuisinart review in the comments section of this evaluation.</td><td>List(several, years, ago, my, boyfriend, purchased, acuisinart, ice, 30bc, pure, indulgence, 2, quart, automatic, frozen, yogurt, sorbet, and, ice, cream, maker, i, was, so,

This one definitely attracts ants as opposed to other brands that just don't have any effect on them. It helped me figure out where is the colony because of ant trail. Before putting it out I had no idea what is the source. Luckily ants were coming from under the baseboard in bathroom behind toilet bowl. I put these just in front of the ant hole. Ant stormed on them and didn't bother coming any further so no ant was seen in rest of the house as long as we have the baits in front of the colony. It seems to work because ants went crazy on it for 2 days and then disappeared, after 2 days new batch of ants went crazy on them. I kept replacing with new bait stations. It has been going on for 3 weeks and 5/6 generations of ants have been fed on my expense. I am not sure if this killing them or I am having ant farm. I have read mostly positive reviews of this product and am so disappointed that it is not working for us. Ants for sure disappears for 2 days before new one comes. Also, they move very slowly just before disappearing implying they had been effected by poison. So this product is worth trying.Finally, when last batch was wreaking havoc on the bait I generously sprayed windex (glass cleaner) on them and on the nest. It killed them on contact and I made sure that a lot of windex gets seeped into the nest. It has been 4 days since, no more ants so far. I think I will stick with windex until I get another solution. Any advice?Am I attracting ants from different colonies? But source of trail is always the same place, the hole behind bowl. Can there be multiple colonies in the walls or ground but ants are showing up from same hole because I put bait in front of it? To counter that problem I am going to put cinnamon sticks in front of that hole as it has worked for another hole in the house. No ants are seen coming out of bedroom hole that is stucked with cinnamon sticks for 2 months now. On unrelated note, I have killed 5 ants that looked like queens a couple of weeks ago. I was so happy to catch them believing that killing queen is the end of colony but no success on that one.</td><td>List(i, got, the, same, product, for, 6, from, home, depot, this, one, definitely, attracts, ants, as, opposed, to, other, brands, that, just, don, t, have, any, effect, on, them, it, helped, me, figure, out, where, is, the, colony, because, of, ant, trail, before, putting, it, out, i, had, no, idea, what, is, the, source, luckily, ants, were, coming, from, under, the, baseboard, in, bathroom, behind, toilet, bowl, i, put, these, just, in, front, of, the, ant, hole, ant, stormed, on, them, and, didn, t, bother, coming, any, further, so, no, ant, was, seen, in, rest, of, the, house, as, long, as, we, have, the, baits, in, front, of, the, colony, it, seems, to, work, because, ants, went, crazy, on, it, for, 2, days, and, then, disappeared, after, 2, days, new, batch, of, ants, went, crazy, on, them, i, kept, replacing, with, new, bait, stations, it, has, been, going, on, for, 3, weeks, and, 5, 6, generations, of, ants, have, been, fed, on, my, expense, i, am, not, sure, if, this, killing, them, or, i, am, having, ant, farm, i, have, read, mostly, positive, reviews, of, this, product, and, am, so, disappointed, that, it, is, not, working, for, us, ants, for, sure, disappears, for, 2, days, before, new, one, comes, also, they, move, very, slowly, just, before, disappearing, implying, they, had, been, effected, by, poison, so, this, product, is, worth, trying, finally, when, last, batch, was, wreaking, havoc, on, the, bait, i, generously, sprayed, windex, glass, cleaner, on, them, and, on, the, nest, it, killed, them, on, contact, and, i, made, sure, that, a, lot, of, windex, gets, seeped, into, the, nest, it, has, been, 4, days, since, no, more, ants, so, far, i, think, i, will, stick, with, windex, until, i, get, another, solution, any, advice, am, i, attracting, ants, from, different, colonies, but, source, of, trail, is, always, the, same, place, the, hole, behind, bowl, can, there, be, multiple, colonies, in, the, walls, or, ground, but, ants, are, showing, up, from, same, hole, because, i, put, bait, in, front, of, it, to, counter, that, problem, i, am, going, to, put, cinnamon, sticks, in, front, of, that, hole, as, it, has, worked, for, another, hole, in, the, house, no, ants, are, seen, coming, out, of, bedroom, hole, that, is, stucked, with, cinnamon, sticks, for, 2, months, now, on, unrelated, note, i, have, killed, 5, ants, that, looked, like, queens, a, couple, of, weeks, ago, i, was, so, happy, to, catch, them, believing, that, killing, queen, is, the, end, of, colony, but, no, success, on, that, one)</td><td>List(got, product, 6, home, depot, one, definitely, attracts, ants, opposed, brands, effect, helped, figure, colony, ant, trail, putting, idea, source, luckily, ants, coming, baseboard, bathroom, behind, toilet, bowl, put, front, ant, hole, ant, stormed, didn, bother, coming, ant, seen, rest, house, long, baits, front, colony, seems, work, ants, went, crazy, 2, days, disappeared, 2, days, new, batch, ants, went, crazy, kept, replacing, new, bait, stations, going, 3, weeks, 5, 6, generations, ants, fed, expense, sure, killing, ant, farm, read, mostly, positive, reviews, product, disappointed, working, us, ants, sure, disappears, 2, days, new, one, comes, also, move, slowly, disappearing, implying, effected, poison, product, worth, trying, finally, last, batch, wreaking, havoc, bait, generously, sprayed, windex, glass, cleaner, nest, killed, contact, made, sure, lot, windex, gets, seeped, nest, 4, days, since, ants, far, think, stick, windex, get, another, solution, advice, attracting, ants, different, colonies, source, trail, always, place, hole, behind, bowl, multiple, colonies, walls, ground, ants, showing, hole, put, bait, front, counter, problem, going, put, cinnamon, sticks, front, hole, worked, another, hole, house, ants, seen, coming, bedroom, hole, stucked, cinnamon, sticks, 2, months, unrelated, note, killed, 5, ants, looked, like, queens, couple, weeks, ago, happy, catch, believing, killing, queen, end, colony, success, one)</td><td>List(0, 544, List(0, 2, 5, 7, 14, 19, 21, 30, 31, 39, 40, 42, 48, 52, 56, 58, 66, 69, 71, 79, 80, 90, 95, 103, 107, 112, 113, 116, 121, 122, 124, 137, 142, 143, 146, 151, 162, 170, 184, 193, 195, 201, 202, 208, 234, 238, 240, 266, 272, 274, 299, 319, 333, 343, 369, 410, 506, 517, 520, 539), List(3.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>We purchased the Razor MX500 for our 4 year old son.

I was so excited to have it installed and to start using it.  Oddly... for all the attention-to-detail and shining of all of the Chrome that obviously went into the making of this amplifier, when I took it out of the box , it was all covered with slimy, greasy, oily fingerprints, kinda like Vasoline (&lt;--???) or something like that but not sticky, yet it was all in the original box and packaging. But, oh well.Took it to a professional installer to have it done up all nice-and-neat. I watched as they hooked up just the Ground and Power Cables. So far so good. Then they hooked-up the remote wire and every time you turn the Key, the Amplifier goes into Protect Mode, turn off the car it goes off.  Turn on the Key again, it goes into Protect Mode again. It has never done its job or turned on even for a Second.

I installed a recent software upgrade and it now causes my printer scanner - Brother/PaperPort software - to be inoperable. When I went to contact their Technical Support staff, as in the past, I find that they had inactivated my user name and password, and removed any way to contact them by telephone. They are selling, in my opinion, the same piece of junk that has been around several years, with no physical improvement; software that never operates flawlessly; and an interest only in sucking you into their cloud. This could be a useful product if a reputable company was selling and supporting it. That is not the case in my opinion.I subsequently contacted PaperPort and they said the problem is a Neat software conflict - to call and tell them that. I did. Neat had me delete several files from the initial install, that nobody knew what they did, and PaperPort and Neat then worked correctly. Very poor software development by Neat.Update 1/11/14Neat Desktop broke so I bought a new one on sale at BJ's. Installed the current version of the software from the included disk. It would not scan. Called Neat and they downloaded some files. That initially worked, but then everything failed. They promised to research the problem and call me back. Never heard from them again. I uninstalled the \"upgraded\" Neat software and installed an older save. Bingo. It scans. This machine though doesn't feed the paper automatically. You have to give it a push to get the thing started. Terrible output tray. You would think they would have tried to make some hardware improvements over the years, and could issue bug-free software. But I guess they are too busy with their heads in the clouds. Good concept. Lousy product. Poor customer support.

After using a cheap beach cart with inadequate wheels for the last couple years, I was willing to spend serious money to get a cart that rolled well on sand and could handle all of our gear: A boombox, a small cooler, two beach chairs and an umbrella. I thought this cart would be the \"end all be all\" of beach carts. It is not. The wheels are certainly awesome, perfect for the beach sand.  However, the cart itself is flimsy, it has a lot of parts and it bends passed the designed positions at times. The wheels simply \"click\" on which really make me question the longevity of the cart.  More annoying, it's weight distribution is poorly engineered. I have to push down on the cart while I drag it, or it will fling back to the upright position! Perhaps it should be a few inches taller to accommodate the weight distribution better, or the wheels moved closer inward towards the base.I did consider the big brother of this cart, the non-mini version, however, those wheels were just way too big and embarrassing for me to haul around South Beach. Additionally, the price tag of that model is simply unacceptable.Further down on my complaint list: this thing wobbles a bit and I am worried it will tip at times on uneven terrain. Also, the yellow color is less than preferable for my taste. The straps it came with are fairly useless, and as others have suggested, bungy cords work better.In conclusion, I do like this cart, however, for the price tag it should not lack in any of the areas aforementioned. While I will continue to use this cart, I would not recommend it at this price point. It could definitely use some improvement. If this cart were half the price I would give it more stars.******UPDATE******This cart got a flat after the third use. Bought it less than a month ago and now it can't be used without repair.

This has a rubber tip with 3 slits, and drips when it is in any other position other than upright.

The color matched the under sink cabinet perfectly. That was about it. Not all the issues we had are with the shelf. Apparently the company that built this house hired mathematically challenged workers. The studs in the downstairs guest bath are spaced farther apart than the rest of the house and they installed the toilet to the left of center. Of course, that means anything mounted above the toilet is going to be off center. So, shelf wasn't going to work there. All was not lost though, it found a home in the 16 year old's bedroom and is doing double duty as a book/display shelf.Issues with the shelf itself were- 1. the screws were way too short. Even screwed into the studs, there was no way they were going to go into the wall anywhere near far enough to hold the shelf. 2. Right side cracked a bit when it was put together. Whether this was the result of the frustrated 50 year old male who was putting it together or a flaw in the actual shelf, I do not know.

I have a foot injury which just won't seem to heal. I tried using crutches and they're so hard on the rest of your body. This device puts a little stress on the good foot, but nothing like crutches, and very little strain on your upper body. It has sturdy, wide wheels that roll very smoothly. The rear wheels being placed close together leaves space for the foot that you are propelling yourself with. The front wheels turn pretty sharply, but due to the length of the unit, the overall turning radius is still pretty big. The front tiller folds down for transport, although it doesn't lock in place in the folded position, so it can flop around when you try to pick it up to stow it in the car. The mechanism to lock/unlock the tiller in the upright position is a little cumbersome, but workable.  When I got the unit, the tiller was unstable when I leaned on it, but I was able to tighten various joints to eliminate this problem. In addition to resting your knee on the pad to move about you can sit on it to do tasks. The brakes are pretty effective and the unit feels quite stable, so I have no fear of gliding down a long decline. It's possible to go up or down a short step, but a little tricky.  The unit is very solidly built, with heavy duty welds at all major joints.

The potential was there but it was truly an awful product. Multiple disconnects, awful display, single touch, glitchy apps. So as an admitted Sony fanboy I decided I did not lose my idealism and gave this watch a try.I'll start with looks and style. Only Apple rivals Sony's classy clean looks in my opinion but in this case I have to warn the public that the pictures make the watch look heavy especially the  brushed aluminum on the side of the watch. It looks like heavy metal and the screen looks like hard glass. Neither is the case, at close inspection and feel, it actually feels and looks like plastic. So if you are expecting heavy materials, you will be disappointed. Luckily the watch is still very attractive and certainly gets lots of looks. In the end I preferred the light weight given I would have it on my wrist for long periods of time.The display is much improved. The color is much more vibrant and clear than it's predecessor and the apps look pretty. It's predecessor offered the ability to view pictures, but they were extremely pix elated and barely view able. Now the pics look great on this little screen. It even displays full album art when playing music. Full functionality for music is there to. back forward, volume control. The weather app is simple and pretty. All functional. Love the find my phone feature to. The only problem with this screen is it's extremely difficult to see anything outside when there is nothing but blazing sun. (I live in Arizona). You live in Seattle and you will be in heaven.Overall, love the watch and it connects wonderfully with my Sony S phone. Connection is strong and I honestly have not had an instant of disconnect unless I walked 15 feet away and even then when I got back to range I simply pressed the button and it reconnected itself. Didn't even have to touch the phone. Which makes me wonder why some people were complaining about connections and can only figure my phone is more compatible since it's a sony.I also read complaints about the proprietary power connection. Do I prefer a universal connector? Yes Does it bother me that it's proprietary? not really unless I'm planning on losing it. Not the end of the world. Also read the complaint about the clip. No problems so far. Love the fact I can clip it on my back or wear it as a watch. I also heard a complaint about the watch turning on when it got bumped due to work. This watch should never be worn at a work site involving lots of physical activity that would cause you to bump it on things. This watch is fragile and could easily break or scratch. This watch is more of a casual fashion watch you wear when you go out.Overall love, the product but what keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the price, the materials and the low visibility of screen in the bright sun. If this watch was about 80 bucks, I would  give it a five star rating for sure. All in all, if you have the money, this watch is wonderful.Update 1/11/13: Had the watch for a while now and still performing like a champ. No breaks and had many many compliments on the watch.

They're completely weather tight and keep the noise out, but very bulky, cumbersome, and heavy. I like the 2 piece half doors much more than the full doors because they're lightweight, and take up far less space.  Taking the full doors off always meant leaving them at home due to their size and weight.  With the soft doors, I can leave the house early in the morning when it's cold, and keep them on.  Later in the day, when it warms up, I can take them off, break them down into two pieces, and just stash them behind the seat.  If it gets cold, or I need to lock the Jeep up, they go right back on in just a few minutes.I also like being able to take the tops of the doors off, which gives me much more air than rolling down the windows in the full doors.  The soft doors are much more narrow too.  My left elbow and knee were always in contact with the inside of the steel door, but now I have plenty of room with the soft doors.I did need to adjust both of mine some, and had to settle for a compromise fit on the passenger side.  Both doors needed to be raised slightly to make opening and closing them easier.  Actually, to make opening and closing even possible from the inside.  Each top hinge pin took two washers from the kit supplied.Both tops then needed to be lowered some, which was easy enough to do by loosening the collars on the pins.  I got an adequate fit on the driver's side, but, the passenger door top couldn't be adjusted low enough for a decent fit.  The very top of the passenger door comes into contact with the top canvas, and there's a gap in the rear-top of the door where none of the door or gasket comes in contact with the door surround.It looks okay, though, and no reasonable individual would expect a weather tight seal from soft doors, so it's not a big deal.  But, since the doors can be adjusted way taller than would fit in any Jeep, it just doesn't make sense to not be able to adjust them shorter.Also, you can only lock them with the key.  There are no inside door locks.  This does make sense, since it wouldn't be very difficult to slip a hand in and unlock the door.  Just keep in mind that if you have a passenger, you need to walk around and lock both doors with the key.  Obviously, they come with their own key, so you'll have a separate door key and ignition/rear door key.I don't quite understand the negative reviews.  I would expect them to look and fit like the soft tops on factory half doors, and they pretty much do.  In fact, I actually get no flapping at the top like I did with my old half doors years ago.  Other than not being able to adjust the passenger door as well as I'd like, I love these doors.</td><td>List(i, was, never, a, fan, of, the, steel, full, doors, on, my, 2006, unlimited, they, re,

The story is derived from the novel by R. F. Delderfield with the same title as the film, To Serve Them All My Days.  It is a hopeful and encouraging story which sweeps across the years from the final days of the First World War to the approach of the Second World War. Many discouragements and even tragedy plague the years, but the general trend is upward and encouraging.This is a film series that I had waited a long time to see.  I had read the book, To Serve Them All My Days twice, the second time just before seeing the film version.  By and large I thought the film version was quite well done. The adult characters are well developed as they are in Delderfield's writing.  Many of the individual schoolboy characters are slighted somewhat in the film, however.  The story flows well from episode to episode as it apparently was presented on television.The DVD version is about eleven hours long on four DVDs.  In shorter films derived from written stories, one can understand leaving some significant things out.  I felt, however, that there were too many exclusions in the film version of To Serve Them All My Days which was plenty long enough to take into account important elements of Delderfield's original story.  In that sense I was quite disappointed.  I felt the film makers deleted too many of the stories about the individual schoolboys which give the written story reality and life.  Plus, the entire aspect of the story based on the survival and recovery of Powlett-Jones' young daughter, Grace, who in the book lives through the accident in which Powlett-Jones first wife and Grace's twin sister Joan were killed.  I use the word \"aspect\" because Grace figures very prominently through much of the story as Delderfield originally told it, partnering with her father from a very young age and aided in her recovery by two of the Bamfylde schoolboys in particular, and finally joining her father as a secretary.  When such a major aspect of a story is removed the story becomes something different.  A bit less of Powlett-Jones love life and common room discussions, and the inclusion of Grace's recovery, and more of the stories about the boys he served all his days would, in my opinion, have raised the film to a level of excellence.</td><td>List(this, is, a, story, about, a, shell, shocked, soldier, david, powlett, jones, who, returns, home, from, the, first, world, war, and, finds, his,

Now, I had enjoyed this the first time I viewed it (holy cow, can it really be 15 years ago? I'm feeling old...), but I'm well aware that it's long been fashionable in some circles to make fun of the film. But you know, I don't think it really deserves it.Oh, there's no doubt the star of the film is the ship; the screenplay itself is less than stellar. It's a bit hokey and clunky and heavy-handed, with no real subtlety or originality. But in one sense, these attributes actually work well with a story set in this era; the simple plot (with a broad portrayal of both good and evil characters) is presented in a fashion similar to how a melodrama would have been depicted back in 1912, whether on-stage or in the earliest short silent films. I found myself thinking that the script really wasn't nearly as bad as many people have made it out to be, over the intervening years since the film was first released.That said, I'm afraid that the film didn't really \"grab\" me as much this time around, as it had when I first saw it when I was a good deal younger. Maybe I'm just getting old and tired and cynical? Or, perhaps it's the fact that I'm not a big fan of any of the actors in the film, and have no interest whatsoever in the two playing the leads. I think if the film featured some acting talent about whom I was enthusiastic, who I was excited to see on the screen, I would have found the film to be considerably more riveting. As it is---eh, I'm not all that thrilled with any of the characters apart from Molly Brown, who I thought was a lot of fun in every one of her too-brief scenes.Hmmm, what can I say---I still enjoy the picture (though it's not one that I'm likely to re-watch often in its entirety) and I do recommend it. However---any film with a running time of over three hours needs to have an intermission! Sitting still that long is too hard on the butt---heh.The 3D conversion was nicely done, but not exceptional. I thought it would be a little more striking, in fact---after the first hour I kind of forgot that I was even seeing it in 3D. But, no real complaints on this score.This re-release may not set any box-office records, but after only a week in theatres it's already easily paid for the 3D conversion process and is making a tidy profit.---SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING---Oh, I do have one huge complaint---and there's probably no need to even post spoiler warnings, because doesn't everyone already know exactly what happens at the end? While I find the very end of the film most touching---haunting, even---the bit that comes before that annoys the heck out of me. I STILL am ticked off that \"old Rose\" threw the priceless blue diamond into the water! I don't care how symbolic it is---explain it any way you like, that was just a stupid and pointless and senseless thing to do to an art object that had huge historical significance. Holy cow, she could have just written out a complete account of her story and packed it up along with the gem---and then upon her death made sure her will specified that the package was delivered to the Smithsonian, or something like that. Man---even writing out these words, and I find I'm getting ticked off all over again! So, that's the one thing that I really hate about this film.Well, now that I'm thinking about the ship, I'm curious to view both the 1950's version ofTitanic(starring Barbara Stanwyck) andA Night to Remember (Criterion Collection)(also from the 1950's). I've seen both films, but it's been a while and I don't have a clear recollection of either...</td><td>List(what, with, the, 100th, anniversary, of, the, sinking, of, the, titanic, coming, up, in, a,

Turns out, I had nothing to fear. This unit is well made and cleverly engineered.Hanging a plasma screen that weighs almost 100 pounds is a daunting task.

I'm a soap addict (as evidenced by my 5 large boxes of dozens of different scented soaps of different types(organic, triple-milled, french pre de provence, bath & body works bodywashes/shower gels, etc.) from online and the local drugstore and other upscale specialty shops which could last me for years and which I box up with my clothes to finely scent them.  I usually look for the best quality soap with the most beautiful exotic scents at great deals.  I bought it at my local Walgreen's because I wanted to try oil of olay bars, it was on sale in the store, and i liked the beautiful packaging and the strong beautiful feminine scent of orchids.  I've never tried oil of olay soap bars since I'm too cheap at the drugstores to buy the more expensive brands but lately since being enlightened on the benefits of the more expensive brands of soaps, I've begun to try the other more expensive brands.  Really, $2.50/soapbar is not bad considering what you get back - of every soap I've tried so far, including premium luxury soaps, this soap has THE MOST GENEROUS LATHER so you really are cleaning yourself, the scent stays on your skin for a LONG time, the soap gets soft as you bathe giving it a creamy texture (not hard like you find with a lot of the mainstream cheap soaps), there are REAL orchid pieces in the soap, and it's moisturizing.  The soap bar gets MUCH softer and MUCH smaller (considering it's small already) as you bathe so it doesn't last as long as other soap bars.  I can't comment on the massaging beads because that wasn't the reason I bought the soap but the feeling IS massaging.  The other reviewer is right, though - the massage beads on top of the soap only last for a couple of bathings.  Overall, I'd compare its quality to just as good as Yardley's soap with a more exotic unique beautiful scent.  Now, if only Yardley could make the same type of soap, I'd be in soap heaven!! :-)As with any soap, if you want to have it last longer, keep it away from water and get a soapholder with holes on the bottom so the water doesn't stay to liquefy the soap.</td><td>List(first, of, all, i, didn, t, buy, this, soap, because, i, wanted, the, massaging, qualities, i, m, a, soap, addict, as, evidenced, by,

I was skeptical at first because they usually could not care less about store bought toys.  But the concept of a rolling ball and central scratcher seemed too good to pass up, especially since Amazon's price is about 1/2 what they charge at the pet store.The toy arrives completely assembled.  You just unwrap it and set it on the floor.  The track has a little plastic ball that can does not easily fall out but can be easily removed with a tug upward.  The central scratch pad is basically a circle of cardboard cut on end so the surface is rough.The product description mentions including catnip, but ours did not have it included.  Even without the catnip, both of our cats immediately tugged at the scratch pad with their claws.  They did seem to be fascinated by the rolling ball, but they seemed to enjoy laying on the toy more than anything, especially with catnip sprinkled on it.  I replaced the ball with one of the lighted star chaser balls, and they both seemed a lot more interested in pushing the ball around.  Adding catnip to the cardboard encouraged them to play with it all the more.I bought a package of replacement scratcher inserts (somewhat expensive at roughly $3.50 each) but found you can extend the life of the insert by simply popping it out and putting it back in with the bottom side up when the top wears out.  Our cats ripped up the first insert pretty quickly, but they have since lasted much longer.This was a very worthwhile investment.  Our cats enjoyed it so much that I bought a Star Chaser model of the same toy so each could play with one (important since both seem content to just sit or lay on it often).  If you are considering purchase I would recommend buying the Star Chaser Bonus Pack moderlBergan Star Chaser Bonus Pack includes Extra Turbo Scratch Pad and Extra Catnip, Pink.

Even the velcro that holds the stamps on the letters seems as though it will last for years to come.The letters are different thicknesses and sizes so only certain ones can go through certain slots, so it's a bit of a puzzle for the child to figure out which takes the monotony out of the whole thing. My daughter actually uses a little sling bag to &#34;collect&#34; the letters after they've all been delivered. I like that there's even a little piece of foam for cushion in the bottom of the mailbox to lessen the loudness of the drop.The only issue we've really had is with misplacing the little mailbox key. It doesn't really fit snug into the lock, which is fine because it's one less thing your child will have to worry about is sticking the key in perfectly.

With its 127mm aperture, I could easily view planets, stars, and also the moon with great ease. The telescope mount is german equatorial, which was useful as it allows you to track down the star you want to find in the night sky by countering the earth's rotation.

I have eczema on my upper arms and within two days this product took care of it, as in they are soft and smooth. I also use this on my face a lot. I tend have some mild rosacea on my cheeks and acne-prone skin. I use my facial anti-aging serium and then put a layer of this over my whole face and neck for moisture. After a few minutes, I then put an extra amount on my cheeks where I have the rosacea and it smooths it out and calms it down. This product has AHAs in it, so I'm surprised it didn't cause me to flare up.  As I said, I also use this on my neck, where I have always had rough, bumpy skin, and it smooths it into buttery softness. It does leave a bit of a 'tacky' feeling for a few hours, but I only use it at night. I REALLY wish Eucerin would make this exact product (NO SPFs as they irritate my skin beyond belief!) into a face lotion that absorbs well into facial skin (it's non-comodonogenc so it does not exactly absorb into the skin, but sits on top more). I've tried some of their face lotions and was not that impressed. I think Eucerin needs to approach their face lotions from their current line of body moisturizers and tweak them slightly. I want my facial moisturizer to be super moisturizing, have urea in it, have anti-aging benefits, and feel like I have nothing on it at all. Not asking much, I know!!  But, I know it's possible and I know Eucerin can do it because they have made a magical product in this moisturizer. For the record, I hate their original body lotion!  It's greasy and doesn't seem to do much to help my skin out. Give this a try!

A hex key is the hardest tool to work with, and stripped out the head of the screw about 1/4\" away from being tight.  That's after pre-drilling the hole.  So the whole mount has been loose all this time.  And you can't undo it because the hex key stripped out the head.  The words coming out of my mouth at the time would have made a truck driver blush.So it finally came time that I wanted to fix it by doing it right and replace the crappy screws they sent with proper lag bolts you'd install with a socket wrench.So I bought the Grabit screw extractors.  Sure they're late night TV fodder, but figured I'd give it a shot, as the set was cheaper than individual screw extractors at Home Depot.And they worked wonderfully.I had those crappy screws removed in about 5 seconds.Then using a proper method of a socket wrench had the whole thing remounted in about 2 minutes instead of the half hour I spent the first time cussing and yelling.Anyways, the set of Grabits are [........], and every tool kit should have a set.</td><td>List(so, about, year, and, a, half, ago, i, hung, a, 19, flatscreen, on, the, wall, in, the, den, and, it, was, a, horrible, experience, you, see, whoever, the, engineer, was, that, designed, it, should, be, flogged, and, their, engineer, credentials, shoved, up, their, you, had, to, screw, two, 1, 43, screws, those, are, pretty, big, into, a, 24, stud, in, the, wall, using, a, hex, key, a, hex, key, is, the, hardest, tool, to, work, with, and, stripped, out, the, head, of, the, screw, about, 1, 4, away, from, being, tight, that, s, after, pre, drilling, the, hole, so, the, whole, mount, has, been, loose, all, this, time, and, you, can, t, undo, it, because, the, hex, key, stripped, out, the, head, the, words, coming, out, of, my, mouth, at, the, time, would, have, made, a, truck, driver, blush, so, it, finally, came, time, that, i, wanted, to, fix, it, by, doing, it, right, and, replace, the, crappy, screws, they, sent, with, proper, lag, bolts, you, d, install, with, a, socket, wrench, so, i, bought, the, grabit, screw, extractors, sure, they, re, late, night, tv, fodder, but, figured, i, d, give, it, a, shot, as, the, set, was, cheaper, than, individual, screw, extractors, at, home, depot, and, they, worked, wonderfully, i, had, those, crappy, screws, removed, in, about, 5, seconds, then, using, a, proper, method, of, a, socket, wrench, had, the, whole, thing, remounted, in, about, 2, minutes, instead, of, the, half, hour, i, spent, the, first, time, cussing, and, yelling, anyways, the, set, of, grabits, are, and, every, tool, kit, should, have, a, set)</td><td>List(year, half, ago, hung, 19, flatscreen, wall, den, horrible, experience, see, whoever, engineer, designed, flogged, engineer, credentials, shoved, screw, two, 1, 43, screws, pretty, big, 24, stud, wall, using, hex, key, hex, key, hardest, tool, work, stripped, head, screw, 1, 4, away, tight, pre, drilling, hole, whole, mount, loose, time, undo, hex, key, stripped, head, words, coming, mouth, time, made, truck, driver, blush, finally, came, time, wanted, fix, right, replace, crappy, screws, sent, proper, lag, bolts, d, install, socket, wrench, bought, grabit, screw, extractors, sure, re, late, night, tv, fodder, figured, d, give, shot, set, cheaper, individual, screw, extractors, home, depot, worked, wonderfully, crappy, screws, removed, 5, seconds, using, proper, method, socket, wrench, whole, thing, remounted, 2, minutes, instead, half, hour, spent, first, time, cussing, yelling, anyways, set, grabits, every, tool, kit, set)</td><td>List(0, 544, List(8, 13, 19, 21, 26, 28, 31, 36, 48, 53, 55, 60, 63, 64, 71, 77, 79, 83, 94, 96, 97, 106, 113, 130, 141, 151, 155, 165, 200, 228, 246, 269, 272, 277, 301, 305, 314, 318, 369, 388, 439, 443, 470, 476, 488, 524), List(4.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(3.4174978792026356, -3.4174978792026356))</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.9682469344598165, 0.031753065540183596))</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>So happy with the performance and utility of my other cabinet, ordered two more to sit side by side in a new remodel.

I'm glad to say that it has funcioned satisfactorily well in both areas.I'm guessing the people complaining about the suction cups on the windshield mount got either a bad batch or have very, VERY dirty windshields, because the windshield mount installation procedure was a breeze. I drive a 2008 Toyota Yaris, which has a very irregular dashboard shape&distribution; (not the usual flat car dashes, which are getting to be more and more of a rare sight these days), so for installation I put the unit on the mount to measure where I should put the suction cups, and as I was measuring it, I realized it was already set in place, needing nothing more than a slight push on the suction cups to ensure a good fit on the windshield.Within 15 minutes of installation, this cute little unit detected a cop with a radar gun about one kilometer away, on the other side of a hill, with plenty of time to slow down.I've only recently acquired this unit, but since I'm not a racecar driver and don't really ever drive 20-30km/h over the posted speed limit, this unit's sensibility to radar gun signals is pretty good for me.Bottom line, it's a 70-buck radar detector, which gives you a lot of bang for your buck.

It felt like I was taking a chemical bath and my skin was burning. Also we were getting pimples in our armpits. We got this solar shower and it fixed ALL of our problems. We filled it up with filtered R.O. water and put it out in the sun to heat up. You have to hang it high (head height) for it to work the best. Being frugal both me and my wife were able to take a shower (1 gallon each). This shower holds about 2 gallons of water (hard to get more water in it). 3 to 4 gallon solar shower (actual gallons) would be optimal for 2 people. I wish this product was BPA free. The plastic has a strong smell to it. This product definately saved us from the toxic sludge they call water in Vegas.

Put in 4 new batteries, they only lasted maybe 5 hours (over a few days).

They still had 75% of their charge!!!  My remote controls can use these for another 1/2 year...LeapFrog intentionally designed their device to:(a) not charge via USB (nor does it use \"micro USB\" like every device in the last 2 years, and required by law in Europe)(b) not use rechargeable batteries (\"dies\" at the voltage of normal rechargeables)(c) die when normal batteries are still 75%(d) Why didn't they just use a rechargeable internal battery???

Right Roku refuses to write a customized app in HTML5 for Youtube. Way to go, down Roku.  I will not be buying another Roku related product until they put Youtube on it. Extremely disappointing.- The registration process is completely completely stupid and a huge waste of my time.++ So I went to register my device right using the on-screen code. After first screen, I came to the Payment page where you know I entered all my credit card info in there (card#, exp, security code, billing address, email, phone#). Then I clicked next and nothing happened. I clicked so many times because I thought I was so stupid that I must have right click or middle click.++ Then I realized OMG this registration page was not written for Chrome. ARE YOU SERIOUS?++ So I used IE and was able to finish the registration process. But wait, there's more, the on-screen activation code on my Roku player was still there, that meant my Roku was not yet activated. So now I had to go back onto Roku, signed in, then went to my devices just to find out my device was not really there. What was the deal? I entered the on-screen code, went through all of that for nothing? And this was me doing this who went through 4 years of college, got MCDST and A+ certification and work for 5 years in the IT industry. Even I got ticked out. Why so much bull*. I meant have you seen hacker websites where those sites work on every browser and steal your money faster than the speed of your internet? May be you, Roku needs to hire those hackers to write a real registration website for you.- Here is my recommendation to Roku+ Learn HTML5. It is 1000% more secured and practical than Flash. Flash is insecure and is the devil of the web.+ Put Youtube on your device because I don't know, it is the #1 video website on planet Earth?

I ordered my first one in May 2012. The item I received looked and felt like a quality product. It sealed to my hose bib without any leaking and my only initial dissatisfaction was with the surprisingly heavy force needed to turn the small on-off levers.My initial dissatisfaction turned to disappointment when one of the on-off levers broke off after about 2 months of use (although I didn't keep track, 2 months of use probably equated to about 40-50 on-off cycles). Since I could still turn the valve lever using pliers, I continued to use that original y-adapter for about a year and never had any other problems (no leaks and the other on-off lever never broke).I finally decided to replace that original y-adapter with a new one from Camco figuring maybe that one lever was just defective and the good water-tight seal performance was certainly impressive. The new Camco y-adapter I purchased and received in Apr 2013 again looked and felt like a quality product, but the force needed to turn the on-off levers was simply ridiculous: I could not get either lever to move by hand. I considered using pliers thinking maybe I just needed to 'crack' the original ball valve seal but remembered the fragility of the lever on that first Camco y-adapter I had ordered and instead decided to simply send this new one back.With Camco off my approved vendor list, I decided to give Orbit's brass y-adapter a try. The design looks and feels identical to Camco's, it cost a little less, and I can actually turn the on-off levers with my fingers.

Perhaps the KSC-75s have spoiled me, but the sound on these felt kind of metallic and lacking in depth.  It sounds like all of my music was the kind of sound you used to get in the early days of CDs with compression and anemic sounds.The sound quality does improve if you crank it a bit, but of course, that means your music is cranked.  At that point, it is less tinny and the bass and soundstage improve enough that they are actually not unpleasant at times.So, I'll use these on rainy days, but am sticking to the Koss KSC-75s for most things.

I wasn't quite sure what it was- piriformis issues or sciatica or what.  I went to a chiropractor and she said it was sacral-iliac joint pain.  I found this belt and decided to try it.  But be very careful how you use it.  In fact, you might want to use it only under a chiropractor or physical therapists guidance.  The night I got the belt I wore it to sleep, trying to follow the minimally written use instructions on the tag.  I think I wore it too high.  The next day my pain totally took a turn for the worse and turned into electric lightning-like pain- which seems more along the lines of sciatica.  My muscles were totally spasming.  I think the belt changed my symptoms for the worse.  I went back to the chiropractor and she said not to sleep with it, and instructed me to wear it a good 2-3 inches below where I had it before.  Also she showed me how to use the side velcro pieces which I didn't understand how to use before. After an adjustment from her I felt much better.  I've worn the belt to work for 8 hours at work every day since then and I really do think it helps keep everything stable.  Time will tell but I'm going to keep wearing it.

But I have grown especially fond of the \"Activities\" that the Harmony-line allows.  When you have more than one component to control (and probably 99% of you who are shopping for a \"smart\", universal remote do), the ability to determine which components need to be powered-on (or off), what order to do that in, and any additional, custom codes you want sent to the devices is absolutely brilliant.  For those of you who own other Harmony remotes (or have owned them), you know what I'm referring to.While this remote relies on the same, comprehensive device database from Logitech, there is only one \"activity\" that can be setup, and that activity is heavily crippled in its capability.  The button is \"Watch TV\", and you can only choose the devices you want on (not the order to power them on, which is important in some situations), and whether you want the TV's input set to a specific one.  Nothing else.  The remote that came with my VZ set top box has more programmability.  But if that is \"enough\", it's a solid remote.The other \"trick\" is that you have to go assign the volume buttons to a specific device -- which it certainly should allow -- but the programming was different and kludgy in how you get there, IMHO.So, as I said, if you have owned other Harmony remotes, you will probably find this model to be a disappointment.  You can argue that the price may offset its limitations, and that's a valid argument too.

I wanted to take it back after I spent the first hour installing it. The reason for my problems are two-fold. Problem one is that the directions are barely sufficient. Problem two is that the hardware included wouldn't fit my bike. I have a Trek 7000 series, it is the hybrid style which is a cross between a road bike and a mountain bike.Like I said, I would have taken it back but I got a good deal and didn't relish the idea of returning it. As such I wound up going to the hardware store, purchased a propane torch, some steel and set about making new brackets. This was about $22. The length was about the size of two brackets together with a few extra inches on the bike side and a 45 degree bend. I heated the steel with the rack portion just about completely in a vise.  When it turned red it was slowly pulled down to the make the 45 degree bend.I drilled two holes in the steel at the rack end and one at the bike end. A few minutes later it was all together. I had to provide some of my own washers, lock-washers, and nuts.  The rest of this took a second hour and I still need to paint the steel to make it look finished.I have to say it seems solid so far but a few minor issues need adjustment: the leg straps are too long to hold feet restrained properly and need to be cinched from the rear or otherwise shortened, the harness could be more easily adjusted, the directions say a reflector should be added to the rear but none is provided. And though I make a lot of complaints for the price and my provided labor I feel it's fair to rate \"It's OK\".Other comments I'd like to make. The seat is detachable so it leaves me with a rack if I'm not with my child. If I had a regular road bike or mountain bike maybe things would have gone more smoothly. Who know.. but so far so good.</td><td>List(i, m, not, going, to, lie, to, you, i, wanted, to, take, it, back, after, i, spent, the, first, hour, installing, it, the, reason, for, my, problems, are, two, fold, problem, one, is, that, the, directions, are, barely, sufficient, problem, two, is, that, the, hardware, included, wouldn, t, fit, my, bike, i, have, a, trek, 7000, series, it, is, the, hybrid, style, which, is, a, cross, between, a, road, bike, and, a, mountain, bike, like, i, said, i, would, have, taken, it, back, but, i, got, a, good, deal, and, didn, t, relish, the, idea, of, returning, it, as, such, i, wound, up, going, to, the, hardware, store, purchased, a, propane, torch, some, steel, and, set, about, making, new, brackets, this, was, about, 22, the, length, was, about, the, size, of, two, brackets, together, with, a, few, extra, inches, on, the, bike, side, and, a, 45, degree, bend, i, heated, the, steel, with, the, rack, portion, just, about, completely, in, a, vise, when, it, turned, red, it, was, slowly, pulled, down, to, the, make, the, 45, degree, bend, i, drilled, two, holes, in, the, steel, at, the, rack, end, and, one, at, the, bike, end, a, few, minutes, later, it, was, all, together, i, had, to, provide, some, of, my, own, washers, lock, washers, and, nuts, the, rest, of, this, took, a, second, hour, and, i, still, need, to, paint, the, steel, to, make, it, look, finished, i, have, to, say, it, seems, solid, so, far, but, a, few, minor, issues, need, adjustment, the, leg, straps, are, too, long, to, hold, feet, restrained, properly, and, need, to, be, cinched, from, the, rear, or, otherwise, shortened, the, harness, could, be, more, easily, adjusted, the, directions, say, a, reflector, should, be, added, to, the, rear, but, none, is, provided, and, though, i, make, a, lot, of, complaints, for, the, price, and, my, provided, labor, i, feel, it, s, fair, to, rate, it, s, ok, other, comments, i, d, like, to, make, the, seat, is, detachable, so, it, leaves, me, with, a, rack, if, i, m, not, with, my, child, if, i, had, a, regular, road, bike, or, mountain, bike, maybe, things, would, have, gone, more, smoothly, who, know, but, so, far, so, good)</td><td>List(m, going, lie, wanted, take, back, spent, first, hour, installing, reason, problems, two, fold, problem, one, directions, barely, sufficient, problem, two, hardware, included, wouldn, fit, bike, trek, 7000, series, hybrid, style, cross, road, bike, mountain, bike, like, said, taken, back, got, good, deal, didn, relish, idea, returning, wound, going, hardware, store, purchased, propane, torch, steel, set, making, new, brackets, 22, length, size, two, brackets, together, extra, inches, bike, side, 45, degree, bend, heated, steel, rack, portion, completely, vise, turned, red, slowly, pulled, make, 45, degree, bend, drilled, two, holes, steel, rack, end, one, bike, end, minutes, later, together, provide, washers, lock, washers, nuts, rest, took, second, hour, still, need, paint, steel, make, look, finished, say, seems, solid, far, minor, issues, need, adjustment, leg, straps, long, hold, feet, restrained, properly, need, cinched, rear, otherwise, shortened, harness, easily, adjusted, directions, say, reflector, added, rear, none, provided, though, make, lot, complaints, price, provided, labor, feel, fair, rate, ok, comments, d, like, make, seat, detachable, leaves, rack, m, child, regular, road, bike, mountain, bike, maybe, things, gone, smoothly, know, far, good)</td><td>List(0, 544, List(0, 2, 3, 16, 22, 26, 29, 30, 34, 36, 37, 40, 41, 50, 52, 53, 56, 78, 80, 82, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 103, 109, 112, 115, 121, 126, 139, 141, 150, 154, 155, 156, 166, 170, 180, 190, 200, 204, 220, 224, 284, 287, 308, 310, 324, 350, 356, 396, 407, 416, 437, 449, 459, 486, 493, 503, 514, 520, 539), List(2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 4.0, 4.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(1.8631227757375346, -1.8631227757375346))</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.8656605179444465, 0.13433948205555335))</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>It didn't seem to get my dog's attention all the time.

With that said, this is not worth the $79. I love getting my back rubbed with this stuff but like another review mentioned the scent is not authentic rose and sandalwood. This lotion and line in general does nothing magical for you. The ingredients aren't all that!If you're like me, and enjoy the scent because you associate it with a specific period of your life, etc. then I can understand why this might be worth the price to you (it's not to me). However, If you're new to it and haven't tried it you're really NOT missing out. You're better off finding a higher quality lotion. Google skin care forums and read about the things people are using that actually make a difference in their skin. Don't believe the hype about the sandalwood rose line!Bath and Body Works in general has a ton of low quality ingredients that do nothing for your skin except lather it with gunk like sulfates, parabens, and drying ingredients that are cheap to use and make profit from.  I used to shop there all the time until I became an informed consumer. I no longer buy a product based on pretty packaging, branding, or scent. I look at the ingredients try to understand the \"weird names\", I know which to avoid, and I make sure I get what I'm paying for. Don't be deceived! Get informed before you give your money away.Look up HOMEMADE Vitamin C Serum, the Oil Cleansing Method, zinc oxide sunscreen, and essential oils. No, I'm not promoting any particular brand. Get informed!

I hate my oven.  It is slow to heat up, takes forever, etc.  I was only vaguely familiar with the Nuwave oven.  I suppose I saw a bit of an infomercial on TV for it, but I have friends who have one and love it.  While you could get one mail order, I bought mine at a local store, and it included the extender ring (for taller/larger items), a pizza baking kit, some extra recipes etc.There are a fair amount of parts to the oven but it is easy to put together and use.  I had some fish baking within just a few minutes of setting it up and reading the instruction book.  Honestly, it is pretty simple and intuitive.  You can see the food cooking, and can easily pause and open the lid to check on it.  I cooked 2 lbs of baked fish in about 15 minutes with no pre heating or prep time.  Just season the fish, put it in a pan, put the pan on the rack in the Nuwave, and set the timer. You can actually see the food start to cook within a minute or two.I have some minor \"complaints\" or comments... it would be nice if the heating/fan element had a lamp so you could see inside a bit easier.  In the end this was not a huge issue.  My kitchen is not the most bright though and cooking with the Nuwave at night might be different than the day time.  The timer is a bit different than most microwave ovens in that 15:00 is not 15 minutes but rather is 15 hours.  There is no second counter so 00:15 is 15 minutes and the counter changes once a minute.  Also, the power control is the basic \"Hi\", \"Lo\" type.  But, i suppose half the stuff you bake in the oven is baked at 400, 300, 150 etc.  The instruction book says what temp to use for different foods, and I found that to work fine.Clean up was easy and minimal.This probably will not replace a regular oven for everything, but for basic baking and meals I can see it being very handy.  Like anything, you need to learn how to use it, and follow the instructions.  The Nuwave did just as good baking my fish as the oven did and it was vastly superior to a microwave (ewwww).UPDATE:  I have been using the Nuwave now for 9 months.  I have not encountered any problems with the product.  I do have some observations.  It is GREAT for heating various frozen foods like garlic toast, egg rolls, etc.  Cooking something like a TV dinner doesn't really work well.  It is not great for reheating food either.  Part of the problem there is, that unlike a microwave, you can't put a plate or paper plate in it.  So, use the microwave for that.  The Nuwave is great for fish, shrimp, frozen or fresh burgers, steaks (I do put them under a broiler at the end to crisp them up).  Things that can be turned work great.  It worked great for a baked brie, of all things.  It was great for chicken wings too, although it doesn't hold that many at a time compared to a grill or oven.  But, for one person, it was fine.  If you were cooking chicken breasts you could do 3-4 big ones at a time.  Once you use it for a while, you get the idea of what will work and what won't.  If you like deep dish casseroles, etc. you probably won't like the Nuwave.  It has probably reduced my oven usage by 1/2.</td><td>List(i, bought, a, nuwave, pro, because, while, i, love, to, cook, i, hate, my, oven, it, is, slow, to, heat, up, takes, forever, etc, i, was,

I actually spent $200 on my last trimmer which was a Troy-Built -- great brand, or so I thought. Within the second use it started stalling on new gas and fresh oil, and then after a month had it in the shop due to malfunction that made it so it wouldn't even run full throttle. It still didn't work after the \"fix\", and with that I made up my mind that I needed to look into buying an alternative product.I went to Lowes and decided to look at their trimmer selection. This trimmer was not one of their selections, and when I looked at the ones they DID have, and skimmed their reviews, nearly every single one of them were horrible! I decided maybe Lowes shouldn't get my business, so I went on Amazon and decided to give it a go.I found this one after a bit of digging, and wondered if I should get this, a 24-V or if an 18V would suffice. I decided on this one, but had one thought... The reviews on nearly every battery powered trimmer blast the battery life per use. My question was, \"Ok is 20min x2 batteries a sufficient amount of time to trim what needs to be trimmed?\"I don't have a huge yard, however it is in the city. This said, I have fences all around my yard, some of them chain link. With any gas trimmer I would constantly have issues with the wire getting stuck during use and having the trimmer nearly pulled out of my hands. It made me give up trimming most of the grass around the fences. Let me tell you that with the guard in place, this is NOT a problem with this trimmer. I was more than a little excited about this, as the fences always looked like junk!My yard also has a fair sized shed, a few places the mower just can't get, and an above ground pool and deck, the periphery all needing trimmed. In my front yard I have a sidewalk and a few trees that also need trimmed.I had let these get a little out of control lately as I didn't have a well-functioning trimmer! I would get the best I could with the mower, but after mowing three times this year alone, I realized I needed to get this trimmer ASAP. I started out with one battery (both were charged) and had the other as a \"just in case\".The thing with electric trimmers is you don't need to have them turned on constantly. When you stand up, you release the trigger. When you walk to another part of the yard, you release the trigger. So when they say, \"20min\" they mean of constant or cumulative use. I trimmed the entire yard with ONE battery, and it was still ready for more!I do have to say the actual cutting line is only on one side, so it doesn't cut *quite* as quickly as the gas ones. Also, the gas one that I had definitely had a bit more torque / horsepower ... though I did pay over twice the price for it, so I should HOPE it worked better/faster!If you have a small to average sized lawn, don't feel like stomping over the wires like you would for a plug-in unit, and want to be honestly generally happy with your purchase, just do yourself a favor and get this thing!If I do have problems, I will update this to reflect it, btw. I have only had it a week, so obviously we have to give it time.(Update 5/29/12)Still going strong and makes short work of the trimming I have to do. I have one suggestion as the batteries don't hold full charges for extended periods. When you trim your lawn, put the non-used battery on the charger. When you're finished, don't charge the battery just used until you trim again. Then remove the one that's been on there for a while, and put the one you used last week on the charger. I say this because I did have ONE instance where my battery died, but that was because I took it off the charger three or four days before I trimmed and it didn't last. I had the other charged, luckily, so that was a non-issue.</td><td>List(i, previously, had, gas, trimmers, and, i, m, never, going, back, to, them, i, actually, spent, 200, on, my, last, trimmer,

something like: \"the PK301 will play videos directly from a hard disk\". But, in fact, the PK301 does not support external hard drives.  This is clear in the user manual which you can find on Optoma's web site.  Page 4 of the user manual says:\"USB device: Support USB Flash Drive up to 5V/150mA, but does not support USB Hard Disk Drive\"There is a USB cable included, but you can only use it to attach your PK301 to your computer to add/delete files from the microSD card which you (may) have installed in your PK301. You can also download  the user manual and the MediaConverter Windows software from an internal read-only drive.If you want to play videos from a USB thumb drive, you MUST buy this proprietary USB cable which is not included:OptomaBC-PK3AUSY Micro USB To USB (type A Female, .3M,) for the PK201 and PK301Yes, the optional remote control does not have an \"off\" button. Also, the receiver for the remote control is on the back of the unit so you can't control the unit from the front or side. Sheesh.  Those are the worst of the usability issues.The unit has performed well so far for our video nights. If you're wondering about the screen size versus distance from the screen, you should check out the table in the user manual. Basically, you can't have the unit more than about 10 feet from the screen before it starts to get too big and fuzzy.

I really like the barrel, but you have to be careful carrying your marker (gun) as it does make it a little harder to shoot around corners and I noticed I drug it in the dirt a couple of times as well due to the length (I had my gun attached to a harness and if I bent down it would drag.

And I am not afraid to say that this mouse takes the cake, for $20 it looks like its worth $80. The only issue i had was that the seller sent me a wireless version, but I don't mind because it works just as well. Also where you see silver on the mouse in reality it is glossy black, and the mouse looks better IRL then in the pictures. I will add on to this review in a month or so to check in.</td></tr><tr><td>we recently had a baby boy so now the use of my home theater system is on the shelf for awhile.  My wife also is not into big sound so decided to try out these wireless headphones.  at first i almost sent them back because i took the easy route and hooked them into my receivers headphone jack.  The sound was terrible and there was the dreaded hissing noise you get with some wireless electronics.  before packing them up i decided to hook them up into the jacks on the TV. Difference was like night and day.  the sound quality is great and really brings out some of the background sounds and music that you typically don't notice unless you are in a movie theater.  They aren't super comfortable for long durations but that can be expected with most headphones.  these come fully recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>This is an ok pump.  It has the nice bracket that can mount to your bike and you have it for the road.And although the image here doesn't show it, it does have the gauge, though it isn't the most accurate gauge (not really a problem when the tire is rated for 55 to 100 PSI).Much like one other reviewer noted, the instructions on how to switch from Schrader to Presta are not very clear and should be researched before fumbling with this blasted thing for hours trying to make it work.And like the title mentions, this isn't as tiny as the MINI name implies.  When looking for a place to mount it on my bike, I am really running short on ideas.  The obvious places would interfere with pedaling.All that said, it puts air in the tire.  Slowly.  It is double action, but the throw isn't very much.  And the higher the pressure, the more difficult it is to pump.</td></tr><tr><td>Worked like a charm as soon as put it in my camera. I am happy with the card.</td></tr><tr><td>We had a chair like this when I was a kid, only it was yellow. This one is just as good a product, with the added bonus that it's red (my favorite color).</td></tr><tr><td>Most essential oils need to have a carrier oil to dilute them. Get a good book on the proper amounts for each oil you are using. This is the best carrier oil I like to use! Can use for cooking as well but I use it for it's purity in diluting my essentials!</td></tr><tr><td>My puppy didn't like it very much at first.  He had to get used to it. But now he loves it.  It makes feeding a raw diet so easy, healthy and balanced!!</td></tr><tr><td>This was my first Bose purchase and I am glad I spent the extra money for these!  Although they are not noise canceling, when I wear them they block most of my two young boys out!  Enough to easily fall asleep.  I listen to country music and talk radio programs;  they both never sounded better.  For those who like really loud music, I am sorry to say that this pair of Bose may not be for you.Shipping was great, arrived a day early and well packaged.</td></tr><tr><td>I had never had a selzter bottle before.  Like some others, I had started buying plain carbonated water but was appalled at how quickly the empty bottles piled up.  This one fit the bill perfectly.I now charge about 1 liter a day, adding some flavorings and enjoying it quite a bit.  I start with keeping the siphon in the refrigerator, along with (Brita) filtered chilled water.  I find it's best to let it infuse at least an hour after charging but it is still effective if you want to use it immediately.</td></tr><tr><td>Don't be fooled!  These are tiny little gems, not the quarter sized ones they look like in the picture.Read thoroughly before purchasing.</td></tr><tr><td>I absolutely love this scale. It's light. It's accurate. It stores easily. Only thing to remember is to give it a tap & wait until you see the zeros before getting on. I have used it almost every day for a couple of years now & it still works like new. I even take it in my suitcase on trips. Although I must warn you that if you put it in your carry-on luggage, they will search your suitcase right at security. I've replaced the battery once and it was not expensive.</td></tr><tr><td>A well made functional coffee maker with hot water which works great and is quick. I like the cone shaped coffee filter makes great coffee. We drink tea in our house and this is easy to use for making tea, cup o noodles etc...We use filtered water so the water reservoir for the tea is never smelly like I had read in some other posts. We have been using for over 6 months and we are very happy with the purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>This arrived on time and I can't wait to use it! LorAnn makes the best oils,for me at least, and has a variety of flavors. This is one of my favorite flavors and taste like Raspberry. If you've haven't ordered these oils before you may think it's smaller than you expect but you don't use a lot in the recipes and the droppler helps measuring the amount.</td></tr><tr><td>This switch is built like a tank and running just fine, unlike the part it replaces.  It's nice having something reliable, when other components of my Internet access are suspect.</td></tr><tr><td>I got this for my wife's new car and she loves it. Nice made quality product that girls would like.</td></tr><tr><td>These Zone bars are my favorite.  The perfect combination of sweet and salty.  Plus, all the good-for-you ingredients which Zone provides consistently.  They taste so very good - seem more like a sinful snack than a protein bar.  Love them!</td></tr><tr><td>I agree with all of the high praise and positive observations about this beautiful knife. Big..yes...really too big to carry in a pants pocket. I carry mine in a nylon sheath horizontal on my belt. Materials are top notch. Fit and finish are excellent. I love the squared off corners and feel of the handle. I have been collecting and carrying folding knives for 30+ years,and sometimes I feel like I have paid too much for a knife, but not this time. The lines of the handle and blade are mated perfectly. The overall look and feel of this knife equal a magnificent execution of an implressive design.</td></tr><tr><td>we bought for a Hallloween costume for my son, and then threw it in our costume pile.  It gets played with at least once a week, and unlike other wings, it can take a beating and not fall apart.  Not like the wire and mesh ones!</td></tr><tr><td>I bought the TG3 primarily because of the ruggedization, GPS, Compass and Wi-Fi.  It also promised superior low-light perfomance. I have a couple of nice Nikon DSLR cameras but I don't like taking them in wet environments, and they are heavy. Received the TG3 yesterday and have tried it in all modes, including Wi-Fi in both iOS and Android with the Olympus Image Share Ap. Great images so far. The TG3 will fit in a large pocket and it is not as heavy as a DSLR so I will use it as a secondary camera. I have not tried it underwater and I will probably not do a drop test from seven feet. I need to study low light performance in more detail but it seems to work well. I will post some of my first photos on Flickr under VMI63 in an album labeled Olympus TG3.</td></tr><tr><td>very good full in vitamin c i like the taste in my milk or smothies plus l use it for my mask with milk n aotmeal n is very good full in vitamin c it helps my to my face.</td></tr><tr><td>WOW!  What a disappointment.  I should have listened to the 1 star reviews.  This is a movie in search of a script.  I figured with Arkin and Falk it would have the same chemistry as \"The In-laws\" but it never gets off the ground.  It starts out like a parody of \"Double Indemnity\" and then goes haywire.  It could have been a screwball comedy but goes off in too many directions and just falls flat.  I gave it 2 stars because Arkin and Falk do some good acting, too bad they didn't have a good script.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like the size and the shape of it&#65292; one bag is just right for one blanket or throw.  However, the strong smell is really a problem.  My opened it for days and hoped the smell would disappear.  It seemed disappeared a little, so I put my blanket in it.  After a few days, I opened the bag and I took out my blanket.  My blanket smelled just like the bag.  I was sad and returned the bags.</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered this item because it is so adorable and I have a couple other charms from the same collection (and I love them all). The charm is very cute and looks great on my phone. My only complaint is that there are a couple paint flaws around the face. It looks like some of the white paint got smeared during production and left a white blotch under the left eye. However, I doubt that it is a common issue with the item as the other pokemon time charms I have all came out perfectly.</td></tr><tr><td>This was such an excellent handheld and the wireless was so easy to use.  It's a shame they gave up on it, and thought that the wireless web abilities in my cell phone was a replacement.  This is anything but the truth.  The Palm VII could get email, news, weather, taxi cabs, book hotels, lookup information in an online dictionary or encyclopedia, and do so much more.  The advantage was that these things could be done within seconds while driving down the highway, in the forest or wherever you were at.  I used this thing very heavily when I was on a vacation in Florida and did so much that would take forever to accomplish with a GPS, cell phone or device with a web browser.  The Palm VII lacked a browser because they are slow and take forever to get information over a device like this.So sad they had to discontinue Palm.net and so sad that the majority of people out there are so ignorant.  This device never caught on with the public.  But it will be forever remembered.</td></tr><tr><td>The King of dog toys is Kong.  My pitbull terriers love theirs playing tug-a-war with each other.  Strong and still in operation like the day I received it.</td></tr><tr><td>My son absolutely loves this suit. The strips have been coming off, but he doesn't mind. It makes him feel like a real fire fighter.</td></tr><tr><td>Well, exactly like I said in the title...the app is nice and my 3 1/2 year old daughter seems to like using it, but stylus does not work with the otterbox defender. We have an iPad mini with the defender case on it and no matter what angle or how hard we pressed, it would not register a stroke. Return was easy and quick as always with amazon. Ordered the amPen Hybrid Stylus which has been working flawlessly so far!</td></tr><tr><td>Faulty switch mechanism.  Sometimes it works on the first press.  Other times it takes multiple (and I do mean multiple) tries to get it to turn on or cycle through the lighting options.  I've kept it because thus far I've always managed to get it to work eventually.  When it works it's very bright and I like the fact that it runs on batteries I can recharge (AAA) but I can't recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>So easy to put into your bun and keeps my hair up all day long without pulling so hard I have a headache by the end of the day. I have long, thick hair but it is very fine and slippery. Works like a charm! One of the best, if not the best, hair products I've ever purchased.</td></tr><tr><td>Tasty, healthy and it doesn't sit in my stomach like a rock like oatmeal or cream-of-wheat. This is now my breakfast staple!</td></tr><tr><td>I have extremely curly hair & this stranger works wonders! Most straighteners you'd find at a store like Walmart or Target that range from $30-90 can't straighten my hair without leaving it frizzy & puffy; but this stranger eliminates all that. It leaves my hair starlight & smooth. My fianc&eacute; & run his fingers through it even! This straighter does make cute flips in my hair but it's shape doesn't allow it to make curls like some other straighteners I've had in the past. Overall it does a great job at straightening!</td></tr><tr><td>These headphones are truly amazing. Like lots of other reviews said, you hear instruments and sounds in songs you've never heard before with other Headphones. These go over your entire ear so after long periods of usage, your ears get a little hot. Other than that, these are amazing headphones.Pros:-comfortable-portable-amazing sound quality-very balanced sound-good looking-good price for awesome headphonesCons:-Ears get a little warm after extended use.</td></tr><tr><td>I am 26 years old and I have been shaving primarily with Braun since I started shaving. I had Braun (model 6520), which I got for my 18th birthday, and it lasted me almost 8 years. Throughout the 8 years, I changed foil only once. The old model gave me a shave whose closeness was competitive to manual razors.Finally I decided to get this new model. While it's not perfect, it comes very close to it. It gives a closer shave than my older model, provides a softer feel while shaving and does it faster. It still leaves room for improvement, such as providing a better shave in the neck area, but its performance is still much improved over older models.I cannot say that I shaved with many good manual razors, like Mach III or others, the ones I did shave with, didn't actually provide a better shave than this electric model. Of course the big plus with electric is that it  doesn't cut my skin like razors do. Moreover, it's faster and without any mess.It should be noted that face should be dry prior to shaving, or else shave will not be nearly as close. All in all, it's a great product in terms of performance, reliability and comfort.</td></tr><tr><td>this case fits well & we like it.  We have not tried to remove it.  it is pretty. it comes in two pieces & snaps on.</td></tr><tr><td>Very nice and thick. I like how the leather is muted and there is no branding on the back.I may have to return this one since my watch is 19mm and not 20mm.</td></tr><tr><td>These food groups are designed well, durable, look great, and my LO loves them.  She enjoys taking them out of the crates and putting them back in, in addition we like to set up little picnic's with them as well.  The milk carton and chicken drumstick are a little heavy for now, but she will grow into them.  Overall, we are very happy with our purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>This product works as advertised. I have a new Homelite gas trimmer with a curved shaft and what used to take me nearly a full \"roll\" of line with the old bump and feed method I did with only two 5 inch pieces. I had to \"rig\" the end of it a little to make the retro-fit tight on the the head of the trimmer but other than that, this is the easiest and best product I have ever used for trimming. I highly recommend this product if you have a lot to trim like I do as it will save you a ton of time and even more frustration.</td></tr><tr><td>Bought this to keep my Rightline Gear 100S50 Sport Jr. Car Top Carrier from sliding around on my roof. Worked like a charm.</td></tr><tr><td>My son really loved the movie and at first didn't like the purple minions but once he got this thing he loves them (maybe not a good thing!) - all kidding aside, good quality, my kid is pretty rough with his stuff and it stays together with no problems.</td></tr><tr><td>... which helps keep down the dreaded 'inward sucking action' while showering.  I like the semi-privacy and light allowing functionality of having the clear top and shaded bottom too.</td></tr><tr><td>I love this stuff.  The waterproof part is where the majic is.  I've used this outside quite a bit now. I even have used it like a protective coating on the ends of my fence boards and it doesnt wash away</td></tr><tr><td>Used this and like it . Did what it said I. The label ,yes would recommend it . I would purchase it again</td></tr><tr><td>Fast delivery. Great chick flick drama. Even I like it too! Much better than the captured copy someone gave us. This is a first rate quality video. Would order from this seller again!</td></tr><tr><td>The Screen that comes with the kit is made from a very solid material, and is pretty efficient at organizing charts and tables that are often referenced but hard to memorize. I have not yet run the adventure yet, but it looks like it has some interesting situations, and ideas in the module. No complaints on what it did include.My only critique would be the lack of text about being a good GM in this particular system. The main book has a lot of information, and a few general pointers that apply no matter the system. I was hoping this kit might have some tips and information on running this particular system more effectively for those not as familiar with it, but who have experience GM'ing.</td></tr><tr><td>The picture for the item doesn't do it the justice it deserves. The toaster is so beautiful and the color is rich and not cheap looking and for someone like me that love features the buttons are a plus. Very happy with my purchase</td></tr><tr><td>I bought that watch and like its style, but not happy with second arm which automatically stop every 30 minute and i have to press start button to restart.But when That arm stop working, watch keep its time correct</td></tr><tr><td>I always like using glass for leftovers because they don't stain and pick up odors. This pretty set adds to an organized look when opening my refrigerator and easy to see what needs to be used first. A definite plus......</td></tr><tr><td>Like many of the other reviewers, the product worked the first time for about an hour and then quits, my watch will stop sometime in the middle of the night.</td></tr><tr><td>While we haven't used this yet, it looks just like the one that is already on the reverse osmosis system.  It is a spare for when we do change the filters.</td></tr><tr><td>I am not able to use a gas mower due to my physical limitations. I was able to fire my gardener and take over the chore myself. It has saved me a ton of money!  Its works just like described. Its easy to operate, maintain and store.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought these so I could take out cake pans and trays from my deck oven and they work like a charm. Good grip, no burns, easy to clean and they are lined so they are very comfortable.</td></tr><tr><td>dont expect to be blown out of your seat with this head unit, but for the price you cant go wrong, after a few montchs of use this unit is quite anoying in the fact the screen is hard to see when it is sunny out, and there is no contrast/brightness controls, atleast none that i know of. but other than that, every thing works like it should and i cant complain too much for how much i paid for it, all in all i would suggest this to a friend.</td></tr><tr><td>I clicked open this 4G disk and found it only has 700MB free space of 3.72GB. Even I emptied everything, it only has 732MB free. How could that happen? I never encountered this problem when I bought things on line. I felt like being cheated. But returning it is a waste due to shipping cost.</td></tr><tr><td>STATIC. These usb adapter tend to give static out of nowhere whenever your listening to music. I think the issue might be flash related, but I'm not 100% sure. If it wasnt for this issue I would give it four stars, because it functions and gives out decent sound. But frankly this is really ANNOYING. I don't use any other browser but Firefox, and i'm tired of listening to music through my laptop and out of nowhere a huge static sound (similar to the sound of the static you hear when your tv has no tv station on).If you have the money to replace the soundcard in your laptop/desktop then do it, because this cheap,simple fix is not worth it. I have not tried any other usb adapters in this price range but I assume they would have their own fault in them, like maybe hissing/poor build quality etc.</td></tr><tr><td>I really didn't like the fact that the only packaging besides the box was a black bag.  there is a slight  smell  to it but its usually expectable from a product like that.  the color was much paler than the picture  online.other  than  that I tried the product  and  it felt very good.  had a  few  issues  with  the  suction  cup  staying  in  place,  but  it  felt real! not too  big  to  make  it uncomfortable  and  the  heads  just  right!</td></tr><tr><td>Love the lightness of the product and how its still durable enough to protect the board going in and out of the car seat pockets for when we travel.  Keeps it handy for use and easy enough for small hands to take on and off in the back seat when the car is already moving.  I like how the design keeps the erase button protected at the top of the sleeve too.</td></tr><tr><td>The belt buckle is beautiful.  Unfortunately, the prong is so large and rounded that it won't go through the belt holes.  It would have been nice to be able to see the back of the buckle prior to purchase so that I could tell it would not work with my belt.  The company sent it very promptly and it does look like the picture.  I believe it is only for a man's belt though.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like this wireless mouse.  The micro-size USB receiver  is almost flush with my laptop, and does not protrude past the charging cord.  The optical tracking is much better than any other wireless mouse I've had.  There is one problem with the design: if you have a tendency to drop stuff, you end up scurrying to catch the skin and the mouse. Which I  have done. Alot.  My dog loves it when I drop it. He goes chasing it as if it were a real mouse. They could have put a more substantial lip so the cover doesn't come off so easily. My dog wouldn't be too happy, though.  Other than that, it's a keeper.</td></tr><tr><td>When I first received my items I was very happy. The color was nice, size was perfect but when we first used it and cut food on it the plates showed the cuts on the plate.  I had never seen that before on any other plastic plates I used by other makers.  Im glad it is microwaveable but I do not like all the knife cuts on the plates. For the price of these plates should they really show these cuts on it?</td></tr><tr><td>I like that it is not bulky and it is not amazing but its functional. Like the color and works for what it is needed.</td></tr><tr><td>This product is okay I find that it is a little to large for my application needs and find that they fall off or start to peal rather quickly where as the ones that I paid a little bit more money tend to stay on for months rather then weeks.  I have cut then down to the size of just the screen and then use a skin to go around the outer edges and this seems to hold them down a bit better then just using the protecter themselves.  I do like how they come with a wipe to clean the screen before applying however I would recommend that you clean the screen with alcohol instead!</td></tr><tr><td>like the looks and composition.  a little pricy tho.  it was listed a few weeks before on amazon for some $10 plus less.  it does the trick however and we are generally happy.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like these bars and look forward to eating them. They fill me up pretty well, and I like that they are sugar free, but without sucralose. Also, my muscle tone has been better since eating these.</td></tr><tr><td>I wish I'd done this a lot sooner, it's just like my old AT&T landline, without the forty dollar a month bill!!</td></tr><tr><td>I'm a side sleeper so I like my pillows more firm.  It started fluffy but after a few days of use it's pretty compressed.  If you want soft, it's a good choice, but as something advertised for side sleepers, I would like to see more loft.</td></tr><tr><td>I thought this was regular brief/shorts with a picture on the back, but (no pun intended)it's like a plastic rear end attached on the shorts.  I thought they could be worn as sleep shorts, but they can't, so I will just give them as a joke gift.  No big deal.</td></tr><tr><td>just what I needed. Its small and it has a cassette player! My collection of tapes is no longer confined to the house. Perfect for my backyard and out in the garage. Easy to operate, I like the AM/FM features also.</td></tr><tr><td>After seeing the Sahdows Fall Art of Tour DVD last week, I wasn't getting my hopes up too high for this release, but within minutes of popping this dvd in, I was blown away. Unlike most hardcore/metal band videos, the music AND the vocals are audible, and dont sound lost in the mix. The crowd sing alongs are mind blowing especially when you listen to it on a home theatre system. The production value is splendid, the music videos are superb, and the documentray is very well done. Buy this dvd if you A. Like Concert DVDs, B. If you even remotely enjoy KSE, and C. Because I said so!!!</td></tr><tr><td>This is a very sturdy toy. The only piece that isn't has been mentioned in other reviews, the captain. He shouldn't have a hole in the bottom because it is almost impossible to get the water out of him. My one year old son only shows interest in the boat or using the cup/fish to drink bath water. Not really impressed at all with this toy like I usually am with Fisher-Price toys.</td></tr><tr><td>Love it!  Pretty just like I expected!Wish I could get it in a Queen size!</td></tr><tr><td>I used this as a gaming mouse, and for $15, it is really unbeatable!  I don't even need a mouse pad, the sensitivity is so good!  It's sleek and looks cool, has some badass lights.  The scroll wheel is sensitive and doesn't feel like a $15 mouse.  The two buttons on the side fit perfectly and are quick and responsive.  As a whole, it's the best mouse I've ever used, and I don't think I'll ever buy another one!</td></tr><tr><td>Great show and it's spin-offs and movies. If you like sci-fi you will like this show. one two three words more needed.</td></tr><tr><td>This USB works like a champ. It was easily found by my PC running Windows Vista and laptop running Windows 7. Does exactly what it was supposed to do and is compact.</td></tr><tr><td>When I first got the polish I was sooooooo happy bc it's such a pretty and perfect color, but I found it to get clumpy and thick fast and now it's such a chore to put on :( I feel like that might just be the thing with lighter nail polishes; my darker colors are of a perfect consistency that even if I dont feel like wearing the color, I will just bc it's so easy to put on. But hey, that's prbly quite an assumption. Maybe my polish was getting old? Not sure, but nonetheless, the color of Bikini So Teeny is absolutely beautiful!</td></tr><tr><td>I have used a Paul Mitchell straight iron in the past but didn't like the new model. I have purchased two other irons, only to be unsatisfied.  I had never used HSI before but thought the price was right. I received it very quickly, even over a holiday weeken, and love how smoothly it glides over my hair. It heats evenly and doesn't give my hair the crimp marks other irons can tend to leave.</td></tr><tr><td>We purchased the Razor MX500 for our 4 year old son.  He wanted a dirt bike and we didn't want to pay for the gas powered bike until we made sure he could ride and that this was something he would like for longer then a month.  He loved it and has ridden it for over a year and it's still going.  This was a great purchase and less expensive then purchasing it direct from the local retail toy store.  My husband and oldest son who is 16 were even able to ride it.  Fantastic purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>Love it, got this for the holidays and the football playoffs as well as movies for the family room.  Works like a champ!  Good overall sound that fills the whole room.  If your looking for a good quality sound bar than look no further, it is a Bose!!</td></tr><tr><td>The ad says it holds 20 oz.  It really doesn't, because you can only fill 16 or 17 oz into it.  There just isn't any way to fill it to 20 oz. I really don't like products with false advertisements.  I do like that it is easy to clean and fill, which is better than the Perky Pets feeder.</td></tr><tr><td>Super small but still able to read clearly and I like how they are sorted by colors. I'm going to put these in my kids journals in huge front so they have it all year.</td></tr><tr><td>They did not look like the glasses in the picture:( I would never wear them in public. But they were cheap so that's ok</td></tr><tr><td>Have had this mug for well over two years, and it has really held up.  Although, the Migo mug isn't the best for insulating, it does insulate (not too important for my need).  The lid does leak if it isn't tightened properly.I keep the mug on a table near my bed (I'm bedridden) usually filled with water for taking medicines.  The non-skid bottom of this mug (the reason why I chose it!) is extremely helpful for someone, like me, who has uncoordinated movements and an imbalanced (muscular-wise) body.  I am in need of this particular item because my physical handicap dictates it.My physical issues are due to a neuro-muscular disease/disorder (supposedly supported by MDA) that is both debilitating and degenerative and involves the progressive loss of coordination and muscle strength leading to motor incapacitation and the inevitable confinement to a wheelchair.  In my experience, MDA is a JOKE!  I have learned that MDA attempts to make everyone believe that they are out to help people like me, but instead, exploit us for their own selfish monetary gain!  During my lifetime of 45 years, realistically, MDA hasn't done anything for my disease/disorder -- not even a simple treatment!</td></tr><tr><td>The water bottle is good but there is only one thing I don't like and it is a little hard to open to get a drink other than that it fits the purpose</td></tr><tr><td>This product works wonders over the winter months.  I didn't realize how it prevents dry skin until after I stopped using it for a few days during the winter.  From my experience, this product doesn't leave an oily film on your face or make you shine for hours under the lights.  Unlike other products, I don't feel like a teenager going thru acne again.The price for the quality is worth it and the amount you need to apply makes the cost per application comparable to other products.</td></tr><tr><td>These socks are comfortable and soft.  I like them a lot and it's easy to tell them apart from other socks when you do laundry because the toe has pink writing on it.</td></tr><tr><td>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron. I can style my hair any way I like and it's so easy to use. Curls come out amazing with this product! 10 Stars in my book.</td></tr><tr><td>Although Beauty Of Wynona is an excellent album judged on its own merits, inevitably it will be compared with the singular masterpiece Acadie. Lacking that one's wealth of enthralling songs, it nevertheless impresses with its own gems like Still Learning How To Crawl, Sleeping In The Devil's Bed and The Unbreakable Chain. The folky song with snatches of French here is The Collection of Marie Claire while Unbreakable Chain, the moving story of a mother and son's reunion, has that same French feel. Another touching song is Lotta Love with its chiming guitars, a tale of addiction and redemption. Indian has Native American drumming and reminds me slightly of Joni Mitchell's Lakota on Chalk Mark In A Rainstorm. The production is magical, as to be expected from Lanois: atmospheric instrumentation - including evocative synths - backing his soulful voice. This is a very good album offering much in the way of stirring, memorable music and Lanois remains true to his vision.</td></tr><tr><td>Got this recently.  Normally I would use Head and Shoulders, but I thought I would try a change in shampoo.  Glad I did.  We all know Head and Shoulders works, but it has always smelled weird....like a hospital area.  Well the Clear Men Scalp Therapy works just as well and it smells nice too.......much better than Head and Shoulders.I am going to switch to this shampoo/conditioner from now on.  I just flat out like it.  I am still an old guy, but my hair looks and feels better.</td></tr><tr><td>This was just what I was looking for in a rolling clothing rack! I can hang clothes right out of the washer or dryer on the hanging bar and lay clothes on the top rack that are heavy like sweaters. I like that there are wheels and I can move the rack near a window to dry faster, and then wheel it back out of sight when not used. This rolling rack is pretty solid construction for price. Great buy.</td></tr><tr><td>Work great.  I have a boy and the front comes up nice and high.  The seat seems to be comfy for him and goes onto the toilet easily.  I especially like that it comes with a potty hook which makes it really easy to keep off the floor!</td></tr><tr><td>I love the simplicity of the dishes and the pattern...just simple!I am not pleased with the nicely shaped cups...they are not very big at all...There is no way you can have your morning coffee in one cup...much too smallotherwise they are nice...I had to buy other coffee cups that are larger for me and my family...so do not count on a big cup of coffee at breakfast...I like the dishes BUT....NOT CUPS!</td></tr><tr><td>I like his visor. It wraps pretty far around your head which is why it doesn't hurt when you wear it.</td></tr><tr><td>Very slow to ship - like, over a week between order and shipping (then the time in transit). Not a good thing for a product that's supposed to help keep you house safe and sanitary for your kitty poop.</td></tr><tr><td>Love this product!  So glad they make this. It's like a super strong twist-tie.</td></tr><tr><td>In reading the reviews about this lens I really started to want one for my Canon EOS, but then I realized that for about the same money, my S95 Powershot gives me similar lens capabilities and it's a self contained camera with excellent ISO range.  Probably isn't going to give quite the image quality that this lens will, but it's very impressive.  I think if you're considering buying this lens and you're not a pro and don't like lugging around a your big DSLR all the time you will love the S95.  Don't get me wrong, I still want the 28mm too!</td></tr><tr><td>I kind of feel it is not fair of me to post such a low score because I did not keep the keyboard.  Obviously I didn't realize it at the time but it did not serve my purpose as I needed something that would connect to my ipad so I could use as a single unit (think small laptop) and for that reason this just didn't fit what I was looking; I did however purchase another version where of the Anker product that served as a hard case as well as a key board and I really like it.</td></tr><tr><td>I hesitated at first to buy this after reading some of the negative reviews from others but saw there was room for misunderstanding by people who tried to use this for grinding large nuts and non-oily grains which it was never designed to process. Pumpkin seed kernels are marginally too large. It is made to grind poppy seeds and works equally well for similar seeds like sesame, flax, chia... and you can mix-in fractional amounts of dry spices like black pepper, nigella, sichuan pepper, annato, lemon peel, garlic granules, etc. If you mistakenly try to grind almonds the first large nut into the grinder mechanism will push the screw feeder to one side where it could jam and will cause excessive wear. The small seeds by contrast distribute themselves in the grinder and create a lubricating layer between the inner and outer surfaces. This mill can be a tool to change your diet to include many tasty, healthy spices and seeds.</td></tr><tr><td>I like these blades a lot. Very effective at mulching, and very durable.I may just sharpen them this year instead of buying new ones.</td></tr><tr><td>Did a transfer of old 650GB drive to this 2TB moinster. Would not install as instrcuted until I check on the error code I was getting with Segate wedsite and found I had disk errors that needed to ne fixed on the old HD. Worked like a charm after that. I love it!</td></tr><tr><td>I had bought plenty of the other kind that is plastic.  After getting this set with the glassware, I like this much better. With usage, this doesn't change shape like the other.</td></tr><tr><td>This headset has stood the test of time. Still going strong over a year later. I use this on conference calls all day and what I like about it is the long battery life</td></tr><tr><td>Why did it take half my life to find something like this machine? I don't get it. For an initial round of clay/compound/polish and wax took me 8 hours and a sore back. But when looking at the results...unbelievable. I am so proud of the job done. What I appreciate especially is that at no point I felt like I could create any damage to my car. When cleaning the cutting pads from the compound with a brush the pad will fly away when the speed is set to 5. So you may want to reduce that to 3 or so prior to the cleaning procedure.I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has fun to do those jobs by yourself. Tip: Make sure to watch the how-to videos at the Meguiairs website as they have helped me a lot before doing my first car.</td></tr><tr><td>My skin became red and irritated and I had the worst break out in years after use of this product.I've never had any sort of allergy or reaction like that to any makeup of any sort until I used this!</td></tr><tr><td>I received this set as a birthday present. I am a beginner makeup lover and have been wanting a full set of brushes for sometime now. I like the set, but there is no list of what each brush is supposed to do. For a novice like myself, that is not a good thing. I opened the leather pouch to a full set of brushes, many of which looked like they do the same thing. It would be nice if there was a guide on each brush was and its purpose. Not only so makeup babies can feel like they know what they are doing, but also to make sure you got what you paid for. It's just okay, but I will be looking for another set as I get more advanced with my makeup skills. Not completely satisfied.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like the fit and comfort of this brace. I tore my MCL in both knees. Luckily neither was a complete tear. Wearing these braces has really helped me to get back into things. It has been 2 weeks since the injuries and I have had the braces for 10 days. I even skied with them for 3 hours 1 week after the injury (NOT recommended). I wouldn't recommend Dodge ball either. It is very rough on the knees. I wear the braces everyday at work and play. They are much more comfortable than others I have tried. I like the neoprene support of some other braces, but I couldn't stand wearing that thick tight neoprene for 12 hours a day. The support of these feels firm and stable but allows more movement throughout a long day. Even when I have to sit a lot at work, these are still comfortable.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a pretty neat product for anyone who likes the old Polaroid photos.  The photos printed on this system kind of have that retro, Polaroid look, but I like it.  They remind me of instagrams (and you can put a border around them like an old Polaroid). They work out to about $.60/print which is not a bad price. Polaroid film was expensive back in the day too.  I wish the prints were a little bigger, but the printer fits perfectly in my camera bag.  If they were bigger, they wouldn't be as portable.</td></tr><tr><td>This is my son's favorite cup.  Seriously he won't drink out of anything else, so I bought him another one off Amazon and thought this would be a great deal because I would have replacement straws for the old cup, and the new cup.  I was wrong.  This is a 6oz cup just like my previous cup, but the straws are clearly for the 8oz cup.  Why would you even do this?  WHY? I admit I just assumed that the replacement straws coming with a cup would be the replacement straws for the cup....I guess don't assume anything.</td></tr><tr><td>This was the worse... It came damaged and it did not even fit the phone... I bought it for my husband and ge was so disappointed &#128532;... It was too big on the sides and didnt fit the phone like it was supposed to.</td></tr><tr><td>Amazing product. It's crazy how well this works. It really does blur the lines on your face. Almost like taking a pic with soft focus.</td></tr><tr><td>Does not fit any of the Glocks I have tried. (G22, G23, G19, G30) Holds J frame revolvers like a glove.</td></tr><tr><td>This album is worth owning if only for Elliott Yamin's amazing performance on \"Moody's Mood for Love!\" This man has not only the best voice of any AI contestant, but honestly one of the best voices of any singer I've ever heard. Like BUTTAH!</td></tr><tr><td>its the right battery for my phone and it works correctly , like it should , just like the original</td></tr><tr><td>The front-left wheel on our Sears Craftsman mower was slipping quite a bit and not self-propelling as it should.  When I removed the wheel, I noticed that the inside gear teeth were completely worn down is a few spots.  These replacement wheels were a perfect match and fit and were also a good price compared to anything I could find locally.  I installed both in less than 5 minutes and now our mower is back to self-propelling just like when we bought it new.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a rich cream, easy to apply, and it smells very fresh, just like real cucumbers.  Little goes a long way.  I use it on hands and feet, as a night cream or after mani/pedicures.</td></tr><tr><td>Works with my Canon 7D and the original charger just like the original battery. However, after >10 charging cycles, the battery life is still bad. I get less than 200 shots with this battery. It seems like I got a lemon :(</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this because it looked like a good design, had good reviews, and is made by Weber.  I was very disappointed with its performance after receiving it. The twisted metal shaft is very flexible so it's hard to put pressure on the grill grate.  The wire bristles are arranged in a way that they do not clean between the grates. I'm using a Weber Q320 grill and would not recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>It serves the purpose.  I used the berlt loops for a while and it worked fine but had to remove belt to remove holster.  Using the belt clip now and I like it better. Its a little bulky and catches on objects that I pass by but stays secure to my belt.  Unlike the plastic one that came with the phone case.</td></tr><tr><td>There is not a lot of room to put your foot on between the truck and running board. The area where you put your feet needs to be concaved like some running boards are designed. You can somewhat put your foot on it but the purpose of running boards is to be able to put your entire foot on for support of climbing in and out of vehicle. These are difficult to do so.</td></tr><tr><td>I LOVE these! I've been using them since 2010. I've even gotten my boyfriend to use it with me :-P Just be sure to follow the instructions on the back of the pack to have the best results. The back of the packet says to just wash your face/nose area but I like to add the extra step of lightly scrubbing the nose are with a facial brush or sponge to expose some of the blackheads/pimples prior to the nose strip. You don't have to though, but it proved more efficient for me. The proof of it working will be right on the dried up strip once you pull it off your nose!</td></tr><tr><td>I'm very happy with the product.  The color is slightly different than the bottle, but close enough.  It works exactly like the directions describe.</td></tr><tr><td>This feeder is Excellent! I have changed my review on this bird feeder.  Initially I said the feeder was of good construction and attractive, but as for a feeder for just goldfinches, which was the reason I bought it, it did not work.  The house finches were the only, and not that often, birds that came to this feeder. The finches, House and sometimes Gold (if the Goldfinches were not being chased away) were always at and prefered, the other two feeders I have; I never saw Goldfinches trying to use this feeder.But what happened 14 months later was amazing!!!!!  The Goldfinches who initially never used this feeder finally after a year figured out that they could hang upside down, just like the picture of this feeder shows, and could eat the Nyjer seed from a position no other bird could do.  I now see 4 to 5 Goldfinches at a time hanging upside down eating from this feeder, and my house finches stay manly at the other two feeders at the other side of the yard.  If you buy this feeder, be patient. It will eventually (in about a year) become a feeder manly for Goldfinches.</td></tr><tr><td>Very goodVery convinient I like that each wipe is sealed in individual wrapper , easy to carry on the go .</td></tr><tr><td>The only problem I have with this Blu Ray movie is the fact that every single one of the discs that are shipped are incorrectly created.  There is a skipping that happens and I contacted the studio but all they do is ask you to mail in your copy & they'll send you another (BUT they DO NOT tell you if the skipping problem will be fixed upon receiving the newer Blu Ray.  Too bad because I would like to get rid of the skipping issue on my Blu Ray</td></tr><tr><td>My girls seem to really like this beds.  They fit perfectly inside the crate.  I love the color, softness, and they wash very well.</td></tr><tr><td>I really liked this movie, but I could not give it 5 stars, although I wanted to. Why not? Not up to a five-star standard, even though I really liked it personally. It had a good mix of music, humor, and emotion, but it just wasn't up to par.The soundtrack is decent, especially if you are a Classic Rock lover like myself. Many references to AC/DC and some to other classic acts.It seems like a watered down &quot;Sister Act 2&quot; -- in acting, in drama, in sound. Not bad, just not as good as it could have been.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this block to replace one of those cheap, Kapoosh, blocks which over time just broke down to the point where I couldn't put knives into it.  This block is pretty big in comparison but it also holds ALOT more knives, it looks good and does exactly what we wanted it for, which is to hold my mishmash of Cutco knives.  I like the fact the knife slots are horizontal so when you put your knives in or take them out, you're not dragging the blade across wood, dulling it quicker.</td></tr><tr><td>I needed a TV for my grand kids room so they can watch and plays games when they come to visit (I have a lot of grand kids so some are here almost on a daily basis). Being old and on a budget I took a risk and ordered this Samsung 39&#34; TV, I was thinking, how can anybody build a set like this for so little money and be any good. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it was to assemble and set up, it took only minutes with just a screw driver. The picture is nice and clear and it can connect to the internet. The internet part I could have done without, don't expect to surf the net as you do with a computer. Because of the quality of this TV I think it's a great buy for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>Used it for the holidays and got my money's worth with turkey and lots of dishes. Didn't break and doesn't seem like it will so I have no issues with it.</td></tr><tr><td>My Favorite Movie!! Reese Witherspoon is a wonderful actress &amp; this movie is so free spirited and fun loving! Ditzy I'd say (my kinda movie, hehehe!), and very Cute! It also shows how Ele didn't care what other people thought of her and she reached her dreams! She may have gone after them for the wrong reasons but it ended great! You like Reese you'll love this movie-a cute movie and a good laugh!</td></tr><tr><td>Ok, Im a fan to, im not harder or softer core than anyone else, but i do love them.  Ive loved every album, no matter how girly or laid back, or mellow, or stoner-ish it may be.  SO from a fans stand-point, i will have to say, im a bit let down on the album as a WHOLE, but there are some very kickass 311 tracks that you just have to listen to.  If youre cheap on dont have 10 bucks to spend on the album, download these tracks: #2, #10, and #11.  For some reason 311 always saves the best track for last on every album.  Anyways, ive been listening to it for a few days, and i do like it, at first i was like \"wtf\" BUT, I urge you fans out there, give it a chance, its not really THAT bad, its just not as GOOD as they have been in the past, maybe to you guys evolver was the best, and nothing can compare to that, but im a stand alone Transistor fan, always will be, i could be stranded on an island with that CD and a keg of beer, and id die happy.  For anyone who hasnt discovered Transistor, I STRONGLY urge you to give it a whirl. Dont Tread on Me will rock live, theres no doubt in my mind.</td></tr><tr><td>Branagh's interpretation of Henry V is absolutley electrifying and as close to an action film as Shakespeare gets.  This is one of my favorite films of all time (I've seen it a dozen times) and never fails to delight  and amaze me.  Like all shakespeare, the more you read it or watch it, the  more you get out of it.  Branagh is unbelievable in his role as the young  king and the supporting cast is great as well.  If you like Shakespeare and  haven't seen this film, you're really missing something.</td></tr><tr><td>This tool I use for many different purposes and all I can say is that this is one if the best investments I've made. It's sturdy and smooth and doesn't get stuck like the cheaper brands. Very well made!!</td></tr><tr><td>Melissa & Doug Shopping Cart was purchased for a Christmas present for my granddaughter....she just loves it! Makes her feel like a big girl.</td></tr><tr><td>Now, this is not your typical botanical blend or aromatic tea. This is a tea that his a little kick and spice to it.  This tea finds itself sitting distinctly in the \"savory\" category. If that sounds like it is your speed, then you will love this blend. Think V8 (super light) and that might give you a better idea of what to expect. I found it enjoyable both warm and cool (but not cold). It is a nice addition to a rainy day, especially if you are in the house cooking and mixing other spices that fill the air. Give it a try!</td></tr><tr><td>I just got this anointing oil, it took a long time to get here, I forgot I ordered it took so long, but happy! it was like a surprise.I had some pain on my intercostals, and I decided to smear some on, and to my amazement I got up this morning and no pain! I'm NOT claiming that this will cure all oil, but it worked for me.I will buy again,  and I recomend this to anyone that wants to try it. It is very inexpensive, worth a try!Have a fantastic day! *_*</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this swim cap for myself, and like the one I bought for my daughter it sticks together when it dries so I have to peel it apart. It doesn't affect the quality of the swim cap, it still works fine.</td></tr><tr><td>I love these little planters.  They are exactly what I wanted and I'm completely satisfied.  The drain hole is very small which I like and mine look just as good as the ones I saw when I ordered them.</td></tr><tr><td>I received a brilliant, shining new Amplifier in the mail. I was so excited to have it installed and to start using it.  Oddly... for all the attention-to-detail and shining of all of the Chrome that obviously went into the making of this amplifier, when I took it out of the box , it was all covered with slimy, greasy, oily fingerprints, kinda like Vasoline (&lt;--???) or something like that but not sticky, yet it was all in the original box and packaging. But, oh well.Took it to a professional installer to have it done up all nice-and-neat. I watched as they hooked up just the Ground and Power Cables. So far so good. Then they hooked-up the remote wire and every time you turn the Key, the Amplifier goes into Protect Mode, turn off the car it goes off.  Turn on the Key again, it goes into Protect Mode again. It has never done its job or turned on even for a Second. So, that's where we are at with it.With hindsight, it is apparent that this amplifier is Refurbished (or attempted to be refurbished by a third grader with no prior knowledge in Electronics).  We put another amplifier in with the exact same setup, and it worked great. Total waste of time, I guess I should have taken notice to the number of the Negative Reviews on here.</td></tr><tr><td>It holds like wax but washes off easily. It has a good holding strength but as your hair grows it can lose the holding power. Nevertheless it is a very good product</td></tr><tr><td>It's not every day that one would like a pen to the point of writing about it. This is the smoothest rollerball pen ever; truly a writing instrument. And as with any fine instrument, you don't think much of it until you don't have it around.</td></tr><tr><td>A friend recommended these scissors to me.  I primarily cut a lot of tulle, and these cut like butter!!!!  I LOVE THEM!</td></tr><tr><td>This movie change my life, now everytime I look at my doctor, he looks like Zach Bacf. So when I ask him if he was Zach Barf, he said his name was DR. Shelly Fishman, MD.Afterward I changed my doctor because he look like Zach Barf and I was falling in love with him. So currently I am going out with Dr. Fishman, buy this movie and you will know what love is all about.+ I also saw someone who looks like Dr. Reed, and Dr. Keiso.I think I am going fall in love with all of them!!!!It WILL change YOUR life forever !!Trust me</td></tr><tr><td>I love this product!  I really like that nobody can see what im typing when im at work.  I would buy again</td></tr><tr><td>Best precision T ruler around! I like that I can remove the T and use the marking ruler on a flat surface.</td></tr><tr><td>It meets up to requirements only thing I don't like is that pictures take w/flash come out red-ish.it looks exactly how it does in the display and I get lots and lots of compliments (: also it was really cheap</td></tr><tr><td>The ghost has a light yellow color tint,it is not pure white as shown in amazon's picture,the tint is fluroescent coating.The ghost must be exposed to sunlight[about an hour] before it will glow in the dark. This figure has an porcelain feel to it,not like the rubber feel of the papo knights,horses,pirates,etc. The chain is painted on the figure with the black ball on the backside.Figure stands up on carpet and other flooring without toppling over.A nice toy for a castle or pirate ship.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like this mascara! It washes off easily in the shower without the need for makeup remover but I've had no problem with it smearing, running or wearing off. I have allergies so was concerned about it running but so far so good! Since I wear contacts, I was concerned that it would flake off, but again, so far so good!The price is great also, I've been paying $14/tube for Clinique's washable waterproof mascara and this was by far the better deal.This is good for length and volume as well, I'd definitely recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>I don't think this shampoo claimed to be moisturizing so maybe deducting a star for that is not really fair, but I do think that my hair is not as manageable after using this shampoo than after using others I have tried.Overall, I still like it.  It has a great smell & it does clean well.</td></tr><tr><td>I came across Acacia fiber when reading about gastro health.  I don't experience any side effects like some do with other fibers.  This fiber is clear, but does not fully dissolve in a glass of water.  The water is a bit cloudy and there are some thicker particles that hang at the bottom.  Doesn't bother me though.  I have mixed it with oatmeal and some other foods and it's been fine.</td></tr><tr><td>The car charger works very well. In fact it charges rather quickly. The wall charger is a complete dud. The only reason I did not return it is I like the car charger, not bad for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>Honestly, I took a chance and bought these for my dogs in order to complete the free shipping price. I was excited that they loved them. They are the perfect size for my dogs (a mini schnauzer & a beagle/basset mix) for a snack in between meals every once in a while. I don't feel like they're too big & I don't feel like they're too small so I don't feel like I'm over-feeding them. Definitely gonna be buying them again. :-)</td></tr><tr><td>I really like this block a lot. I didn't want to spend a lot on a dapping block because I knew that I wouldn't do a great deal of dapping. I'm more than pleased with this one. The largest hole is pretty huge so this little block will be all I need for quite some time.</td></tr><tr><td>I mounted it on my XD .45 and it fits pretty well.  There is a screw on each side that you tighten to and can sort of set the windage adjustment on where the light points to some extent.  The switch is simple and caveman like and may be activated if you lay it on the wrong side of the gun. It isn't super refined but it is deff worth what it costs if you just want it for a bedstand or closet gun.  I think the switch would become an issue if you were trying to put this on a gun you carry around all the time.</td></tr><tr><td>It doesn't fall apart easy like other lanyards I've tried and it's easy to keep clean so don't worry about the white logo turning brown after a while. It is a black lanyard. It shipped fast and got delivered fast</td></tr><tr><td>It is much better than the regular ones that only show blue.  This one has green, blue and off. First, the green is a bit less glaringly bright and we also like the fact it has an off position.Wish all of ours were of this type.  Very nice nightlight.</td></tr><tr><td>It looks like I am the only person  who actually paid money to get this groomer.I had it for about 6 weeks, I use it about 1/2 minute a day, and it is still going strong on the very first charge. I only use the mini foil shaver and I like it a lot. I have no experience with the other attachments.As another reviewer noted it, the charger works on 220 volt too so, unlike most other groomers, this is great for travel. The charger itself is lightweight which is another plus..</td></tr><tr><td>This product is leather and it is a nice quality leather and you can tell because it smalls like leather.  I would recommend that you order this product.  It is also a very good price.</td></tr><tr><td>Appears to be designed and made well and would reccomend to others that are looking for something like this. Larger capacity too.</td></tr><tr><td>I have an inground pool and even though we do have a pool light I thought the kids would like multi colors. I wasn't thinking it would cover the whole pool but I did think it would cover the size of an above ground pool. NOT the case. It covers a VERY small area and yes it is pretty to look at & has more then one pattern of lights its barely visible,hope this helps anyone looking to purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>The sound quality was great and as expected from audio technica. What I like is that these have some very convenient features like a detachable cord and especially a inline volume control feature which is a must have for me with headphones. The sound quality was amazing however I must say the noise cancelling was only good but that's only if compared to headphones 4 times the price so really the noise cancelling technology is actually really good on these headphones. Overall highly recommended and a great value for audio technica quality.</td></tr><tr><td>This doesn't look like the picture....you'd need to style it to get it to have that much volume. The wig color was weird and unnatural looking. It was also too big for my head. I definitely would save your money and buy a different wig.</td></tr><tr><td>I can't believe this is the same product that goes with the Otterbox. This is the second replacement holster I've had to buy for my case. It breaks in the same place every time. I have an office job so it's not like I'm a contractor who is hein rough with it. I don't recommend this product. I'm really disappointed with this holster.</td></tr><tr><td>When I hear a little from this album on official sites like bj.com I think that this album would be not as good as the cover seems :) but when I came home and put it to my CD player I was really shocked in good way.This album start with a really rock song Wanted dead or alive which I really like the music change and the really lyrics too it really rocks, then came classic BJ song Living on the prayer which is nearly like acoustic version but its a duet with Olivia D'bao, then came Bad Medicine with really sexy Jons voice one of my favorite then came totaly change Its my life which change to ballad. . .I think I dont need to write mucht just put PLAY, sit down with glass of fine wine and start dream. . .Martin</td></tr><tr><td>very happy with this item. I gave it as a gift to my friend item is just like the picture.</td></tr><tr><td>I like the case but the stand is a bit cheaply made and there is little shards of plastic coming off of it</td></tr><tr><td>I order these for my mom, who has recently gotten on a pot-holder-making kick. We have tried ALL kinds of loops and she rates these highly. She does find these a little harder to work with because they are not stretchy (and she has a bit of arthritis), and yes some of the colors can be a bit dull, but the finished product makes up for it. After trying all different kinds, the recipients of her pot-holder gifts have decided these make the best pot-holders. They just feel studier and more substantial and like you're less likely to burn yourself while actually using one. The nylon loops are easier to work with and have brighter colors, but the pot holders they yield are not practical at all.</td></tr><tr><td>Very good Hat , every one like it. I bought more of this for my friends. Hat is very good quality and it's not heavy.There is no any issues with safety standard for any kind of work. Construction and Transportation & Logistic .</td></tr><tr><td>I bought the 28-33\" window sash pet door, and when it came I was taken aback by how solid and well made this thing is. No wonder it is over $100. The 4 way locking is neat and simple to use. The door swings easily.The mechanism to expand it to your window is idiot proof. Definitely does not feel cheap like so many of our products feel these days.</td></tr><tr><td>It is very good . I think it is works very well, It is very handy and easy to clean it.  It is very good . this produce is good deal. I like the price and qulity. I use it every day around the house. I like it very much.</td></tr><tr><td>I like this product because of its light weight but numbers are difficult to read sometimes. Fixed it with a sharpie!</td></tr><tr><td>Wow! We've been impressed. After having 3 skillets in the past with the Teflon coating, we'll never go back. Easy to use, easy to clean, no concerns about scratching or what utensils to use, and even heat distribution. If it ever dies (which it looks and feels like it won't...built like a tank!), we'd replace it with the same without concern.</td></tr><tr><td>This is my second year using this and it works like a charm.  We live in the country with woods everywhere, and our dog is in and out of them all day.  She will come back with ticks on her, but they are always dead.  This is the best way of preventing ticks and fleas I've found.  Much easier than the drops of liquid, never got results with them.</td></tr><tr><td>I've used this model of mechanical pencil for over 10 years. It's easily the best designed, most comfortable mechanical pencil ever made. It holds plenty of lead, the side click action is smooth and easy, and I like the wider, refillable twist-action eraser. The design has only two minor flaws: (1) the twist mechanism that raises/lowers the eraser has very little friction, so the action of erasing typically twists the eraser back into the pencil somewhat, and (2) the top and lower halves of the pencil body, which separate to reload lead, come apart rather easily.</td></tr><tr><td>I like the Label.M products and this is supposed to thicken and add some shine.  I don't see either of these things.  I followed the directions and fooled with the hair dryer and everything but this one is a no go for me.</td></tr><tr><td>The Firm isn't an album I listen to all the time, but I do like the album.  I like the whole \"mafioso\" image surrounding the album, it's very entertaining.  It's not Reasonable Doubt or Illmatic, but it's fun and relaxing at points.  I don't expect alot of realism from rappers, just talent, and this album had good lyrics and nice atmospheric music... it's literally like listening to a soundtrack.  I wouldn't say it's the greatest crew album out there, but honestly, if you've heard what's been coming out of mainstream rap lately, you'd probably think this album deserves an Grammy.</td></tr><tr><td>We have had our Keurig for a couple of years and have tried many different coffees, teas and even hot chocolate k-cups. Recently, I was sent a box of Timothy's World Coffee Original Donut Blend and was pleasantly surprised.  My significant other lives for the Coffee Peoples Donut Shop but it looks like it will now be replaced with Timothy's.  Timothy's flavor is lighter without being weak.  It doesn't have that bitter aftertaste that comes with a darker roast coffee which is how Coffee People defines their coffee - Donut Shop is a medium roast.  Personally, I didn't care for the Donut Shop but absolutely LOVE this Timothy's Original Donut blend.  Timothy's says that it is made from 100% Arabica beans, I like this taste.  It is well balanced and I don't have the heartburn that I normally do drinking a bolder coffee.  This is a really good coffee for those who don't drink a lot of coffee.</td></tr><tr><td>Exactly like described. He was surprised and couldn't wait to go camping so he can use it!very very light weight!</td></tr><tr><td>Good heavy weight on the pen. I would like it alot more if the o ring in the cap that keeps it tight didn't fall out and leave the cap loose to fall off. Might I had this is within four hours of getting it and taking it to work. I work in an office with no strenuous work put on it and it still failed fast. If you opt for a tactical pen opt for one without a cap.</td></tr><tr><td>They are just what I needed. I like them to use as a back scratcher and no bending when using them as a shoe horn.</td></tr><tr><td>This stuff tastes like sugar. I can't tell the difference. I use them exactly the same. I would definitely recommend it. Much healthier choice for those of us with a sweet tooth!</td></tr><tr><td>Very cheap radio and Definitely not what i expected from it!! 3 weeks after i had it installed i pressed the button to open it and it broke!! I didnt like it once i had it installed because the buttons were very cheap, i had to press them over and over just to get to where i wanted to be! Very unhappy. And on that note i need to know how i can get a replacement on this worthless device!?</td></tr><tr><td>This was my mistake because I did not order exactly what I wanted.  I wanted the foaming gel and not the gentle cleanser.  I like the smell of the foaming gel better, but all Obagi products are excellent.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this item with my income tax refund.  I was in desperate need of something to help my wife and son get in the jeep especially after I lifted it.  They installed really easily in my 2013 jku.  Like all smittybilt products the instructions were crap but I figured it out and it only took one hour seeing as how I was doing it by myself.  Great product very sturdy and supports my body weight just fine with no signs of stress.</td></tr><tr><td>I havent used this product yet, but itis NOT 1.5&#34; thick.  It is 3/4--1' (MAX) thick.  The straps to hold it in place look like they will work good.  I'm a little concerned about the thickness, as I have boney shoulders.  Hoping it works</td></tr><tr><td>These have been ideal for us.  The cubes hold 1 oz servings of baby food.  As mentioned, the cubes don't pop out like an ice cube tray, but it's not difficult to get them out.  Some purees seems to be easier to get out than others.  The only downside I've found is that they seemed to hold smell a bit.  We ended up with a batch of apple puree that smelled like the squash that had been frozen in them previously.</td></tr><tr><td>I got this printer for free with a computer purchase, which seemed like a good deal, especially since my old one was rendered obsolete by the newer OS. Now I understand why they were giving these things away.DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!Fair warning: this machine eats ink like crazy and there is no option to print with other colors (no matter how full), there is no warning before the printer simply shuts down, and the ink itself is some of the most expensive I've seen.Epson is ripping you off with this printer. On checking the ink cartridges, it appears the printer considers 1/4 full to be bone dry. With a light print load, you are looking to spend nearly $150 a month on ink alone. This product is a scam.</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoy making my own laundry soap but my husband doesn't like that the clothes don't come out smelling like store bought detergent, so this product was our solution.  I like that it is easy to use and not messy.  I wish the scent was even stronger.  That is why I didn't give it the full 5 stars.</td></tr><tr><td>Works like a charm to charge my 5s.  Super fast, super sturdy feeling.  There is a small green light on the part that plugs into the outlet.</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered these right before Christmas 2011 and just received them this past week - 1 month later! I had to contact the seller and was told they were shipped from Hong Kong and did not have a tracking number. Once received, they are very cheap - made of plastic and looks like something from a child's toy chest.  Doesn't work very well on the iPad 2. Does not glide and will not draw lines. I highly recommend spending a little more money and getting something with better quality.</td></tr><tr><td>I will not recommend for anyone to buy this TV Component Bench, as I bought one and the quality is terrible. While still building the cabinet, it broke and the wood crumbled into pieces. Because I did not have the original box, but a box exactly the same size, OJ Commerce (WSports) would not refund my money or accept a return. I will NOT recommend anything from this seller and Amazon should be aware of using 3rd party sellers like these affect their reputation. Made a A-Z claim with Amazon, so let's see what they do about it.</td></tr><tr><td>I've been trying this product for a week. I make myself iced tea and sweeten it, usually, with a stevia based product. This makes my tea taste more like a sugar sweetened tea. My coffee is good with it too.</td></tr><tr><td>I have this in a down-firing box in my F150 powered by a 175 MW RMS amp.  It hits very hard inside the cab, but doesn't carry for blocks.  Perfect for the middle-aged man who likes his music loud, but doesn't want to look like a fool.</td></tr><tr><td>I like them a lot better than my helmet mounted mirror. I can easily keep check on the traffic coming up from the rear.</td></tr><tr><td>My doctor reccommended these and I really like them!  They are a not cheap but very well worth the money and they are comfortable and helpful to my leg (blood clot).  I get the open toe style also so I can wear them with flip-flops in the summer :)</td></tr><tr><td>Small like golf balls but still cool and they are glass balls, for 22 dollars it's pretty good. Looks like the cartoon.</td></tr><tr><td>I especially like to use this Tea Tree Oil shampoo in the winter time.  It helps with winter scalp flakiness.</td></tr><tr><td>I was looking for a cart to fold clothes by my washer and dryer in my basement with a height that would not hurt my back.  Also needed cart to be portable.  This cart fits exactly what I was looking for.  Assembly was easy and I like the fact that the wheels lock.  I found it easier to use an electric screw driver to attach the wooden top otherwise the tool included with the supplies was enough to assemble.  Thinking about getting a second cart to use upstairs.</td></tr><tr><td>This is what i expected. it is a good watch. i really like this producte. I recommend and it arrived when they told me.</td></tr><tr><td>I like this measuring cup, it's like a solution for a problem you didn't even know you had!  I don't cook alot so I just needed something for the occassional measurement that's not going to be too small or in my way, and this actually fits in the corner of the drawer with the mixing bowls (well, sort of, but I can close the drawer at least).</td></tr><tr><td>Works like a champ! Cup holder part pretty sturdy. Will get one for my other vehicle. Love it so much.</td></tr><tr><td>Just got it. WE like it and its cool and will be wearing it all the time. thank you its awesome</td></tr><tr><td>It's a funny thing with Kibbles 'n Bits. Dogs are choosy over which pieces they like. I had one dog that liked the bits but not the kibble. Now, I have a dog that likes the kibble but not the bits. It's not just any kibble, it's the brown kibble. Red kibble gets pushed to the side, also. I wonder how they do that with their big snout in the way.Since I have yet to find a dog to gobble the whole thing down, I'd say it's only half good. Which half will depend on the dog.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like the security of the carabiner option on this retractable reel.  I use it to attach my badge/card key to my backpack so I'm not fishing around for it.  The styling is really nice and the reel travels very smoothly.  Very satisfied and will recommend to friends.</td></tr><tr><td>Thank you so much!Take it and you will like it!Hurry up!</td></tr><tr><td>I picked this up from the hennessey site directly since you got a free scout and snakeskins for both. I have no experience with the expedition but I would assume it works for most people. I opted for the safari as I like to stretch out and snuggle when the opportunity presents itself. This hammock is the condo in the land of hammock apartments. There is enough room for one person (5'10\" 185lbs) to lay with arms stretched out and enough head room to hang a chandelier from if desired.  I am pleased I went with the safari model as it provides me with the room to store stuff as well as not feel cramped. Once you put in a sleeping bag, pillow, and sleeping pad, its a slice of heaven! The asymmetrical design is ingenious and like sleeping on a bed of clouds!</td></tr><tr><td>Not large like I thought it was going to be.  Ordered to keep varmints out of garden.  Too small!Not what I thought it was going to be.</td></tr><tr><td>Like the title. I really dislike this one. So greasy and unnatural color.  I am light to medium sin tone t zone oily</td></tr><tr><td>If you have Window 8, don't bother ordering this. The software for the GPS unit makes Windows crash on me, the Blue Screen of Death. I went to find another driver, and GlobalStat says beware of counterfeit software and that if you use their driver you have to turn off Windows Update. Street Atlas works fine, but I had to buy a different GPS unit. If you like frustration, buy this. It was a total waste of money for me.</td></tr><tr><td>I received this on my registry and have used it multiple times to no avail.  It has not gotten rid of the smell at all, still have a pail that smells like the nasties that come with used cloth diapers.  I don't think this is a useful product which is too bad because I love the Rockin Green detergent more than anything!</td></tr><tr><td>When you are having a fit this brand is the easiest (in my experience with 6 or 7 brands) to remove from its blister packaging.  It comes with a thin foil cover instead of the infuriating paper-backed foil that has to be peeled away first.  They pop right out just as regular gum does.  That itself is worth five stars.  The missing star is for the taste - bitter and harsh unless you chew it super slow.  But to be fair, all of the nicotine gums are like this.  Bottom line - good product, great price.  Good luck with quitting, we can do this!</td></tr><tr><td>Good Feeder, Doesn't leak near base.  I do not have many orioles in my area but hummingbirds like it. Also woodpeckers use it.</td></tr><tr><td>The Sleep Better Visco Wedge Pillow is exactly as advertised. I use it and my bed pillow together and get just the right amount of elevation and comfort I was looking for. I have a slight breathing problem when I sleep and this wedge gave me just the right elevation to allow me to sleep the night through and wake feeling much more rested. Thank you for having items like this available.</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered this product hoping it would really change my mind about using whey or soy. I didnt. I have to mix it with my other protein just so i can drink it. It taste like dirt and grass. Not s very good product.</td></tr><tr><td>I'm using this to train my puppy to come when called just like we learned in puppy class.The leash is perfect for this as it's well made and nice and long.</td></tr><tr><td>It works like a charm. I have used it for olives so far, don't know if it'll work as well with pickles.</td></tr><tr><td>What's nice about this exercise video is that you don't realize how much time goes by!!! You do a 40 min workout in what feels like 20 min!! The women are all very in shape, but I found that actually motivated me!! (I wanted their abs!!)At first, I thought the salsa dancing would be difficult but it was actually pretty easy!! I have absolutely no coordination and by the end of this video it actually makes you feel like a sexy dancer!! Something I never thought I would feel!!  Overall, great video when you are just getting back into the exercise scene!</td></tr><tr><td>We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like this conditioner. I used to like the gel better, but it's very hard to find these products for this shaver, as it's a few years old and not manufactured anymore.</td></tr><tr><td>I was looking for something new that had a nice clean fresh scent and came across this, so I bought it. I was really surprised at just how good this smells when I got it. If you like cucumber melon scents as much as I do, you are going to love this.</td></tr><tr><td>So far so good. This product is easy to use, easy to clean, and comes with some easy to follow recipes. So far so good, I have no complaints as of now. I have definitely filled out the warranty because though I've heard & read great things about the NutriBullet I've also read some not so good reviews. But like I said I have no current complaints and fingers crossed it stays this way.</td></tr><tr><td>Orgain products contain no \"artificial\" sugars which was a key point in my search for an RTD to supplement with. I prefer the chocolate over the vanilla. I also recommended them to my father who is in his 70's as a replacement for \"Ensure\" and he loves them. They were difficult to find in the local markets but it appears that the company is gaining more exposure. Being able to order the case and ship them \"Prime\" to myself and my father is also a bonus not to mention saving a few dollars over buying singles. They are best served chilled. I like to chill them in the freezer for 20-30 min (from the fridge) before drinking.</td></tr><tr><td>it's a present for my friend..  they like it very much.  thank y o ugood d d d !</td></tr><tr><td>I like this product. I take medication that causes my throat to itch & also causes dryness. This spray stops the itching & gives temporary relief. The taste is fine. The only drawback is that it seems the bottle is maybe half-full. I think the price is a little steep for 1.5 oz. If I keep a continuous supply, I will have to order frequently. The bottle is obviously large compared to the amount of liquid it contains.</td></tr><tr><td>If you have a bubble guppie fan like I do then this is a must have item! Purchased this to go with his bubble guppie rock n roll play set! He loved it!</td></tr><tr><td>Looks really sleek and friends are jealous. The only thing that i do not like about it is I accidently got it wet and it broke. After letting it dry out and removed the battery, it worked again. Im glad to have it on my wrist again.</td></tr><tr><td>I have bought this same polish at least 4 times because I LOVE IT THAT MUCH! One coat makes the nails look glossy and healthy but 2 coats, really oozes a pretty pink for slightly deeper skintones! I'm not a fan of pink and for those ladies out there that are just getting into pinks and don't want a pink that packs a punch then this color is for you! It shows up just enough to get noticed walking down the grocery store aisle or snuggled up next to your honey and the next thing you hear is \"I like your nails.\" It's GREAT!</td></tr><tr><td>It is very cute and I like the way it is shaped. It just looks like a black dress hanging on your bedroom wall, so your bedroom doesn't look unnecessarily cluttered. It could have used different shaped pockets but it works great.</td></tr><tr><td>I have to say - this rocket is a blast!  I hooked it up to an electric air pump so I wouldn't have to manually pump it - just turn it on and wait a few seconds (about 12).  Worked like a champ and went super high!  I went a little overboard and put 2 red membranes in at once - not a good plan - the top of the rocket cracked open after a couple of these launches (though it did go so high I lost sight of it).  Stick with 1 red membrane and you will enjoy this rocket for many flights.</td></tr><tr><td>Who knew a human could fall in love with a machine! In a normal coffee maker someone either got that nasty last cup or it was thrown away. Now every cup is steaming, hot and fresh. And do many choices! I don't feel like I'm wasting coffee any more.</td></tr><tr><td>After all the great reviews, was excited.  Can't even get the big three in San Francisco.  Will be trying another antenna.  By the way, this thing is paper thin.  Seems like laminated piece of paper...</td></tr><tr><td>Makes gripping the phone more secure, protects it from minor damage. Fits the phone like a glove, and works like a charm!</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this 25-piece accessory kit for use with my Porter Cable compressor.  The quality and workmanship of the kit is acceptable, but not remarkable.  So far, the kit has all the attachments that I have needed.  I especially like the air nozzle (probably incorrect terminology) for blowing off my table saw and miter saw after each job.Although this product is of mediocre quality, it's still worth the money and gets the job done.</td></tr><tr><td>Recieved this as a Christmas gift.  As a life long Aqua Velva user this after shave was a real treat.  Smells great and has that refreshing tingle when applied.I've used the last this morning, and would like to have more, but it costs more than I'm willing to pay, I can get 2 bottles of Aqua Velva for the price of 1 bottle of Proraso, that's a shame, I really like it.</td></tr><tr><td>I recently bought the LINX vacuum, and never wanting to have to wait on a battery to clean, I went ahead and bought a second battery. I like the small form factor, the quick charge, and quite long charge it holds. I have tried several other \"rechargeable\" vacuums, and none work as long as the LINX.If you own the vacuum or are considering buying one, go ahead and snag a second battery!</td></tr><tr><td>For the price I paid I am not too disappointed. I only paid like $2.00 for the Gel Skin, however I would not pay any more than that. The item does not fit very snug. Leaves a gap around the corners. Also is very hard to keep clean. It is like a dirt/dust/hair magnet. I would never take it out of the house. I tried to wipe it down with a wash cloth but that only made it worse. Also, it probably helps to prevent minor scratching, but I think an actual case is much better protection. I only paid a few bucks, so no biggie this time. But would not buy again.</td></tr><tr><td>My Cat didn't like it is why I'm giving it a 1 star rating...it was sturdy enough and all but she never liked it</td></tr><tr><td>This watch is incredible!  Gets tons of compliments, looks great, high build quality.  It came in a high quality box, with a very good cleaning cloth.  I have had no problems with it.  The only thing worth mentioning is that t is very hard to resize by yourself without a tool, but that's my adult.  The watch keeps decent time.  The only thing that I don't like is that the cyclops doesn't magnify enough, and is a bit hard to clean around.  Would highly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>Nice cream for the scalp, especially those balding areas. I normally have those dry scalp that looks like dandruff but after using this daily, it tried to moisturize the scalp and helps keep the nice cool feeling. The cream is white but will eventually disappear and does not leave the oily effect.</td></tr><tr><td>I'm CONFIDENT that you will get more compliments on this scent than almost any other you've worn. I'VE HAD GUYS STOP ME and ask me, \"Hey man, I don't want this to sound weird, but what cologne are you wearing?!\". I've had women ON ME asking me what it is, telling me how unique it is and how great it smells.  THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO SAY. Try it, if you don't like it, it was only 20 bucks don't whine!!! In fact, don't whine at all, just respond to me via this review and I will buy the bottle from you!Promise you, you won't be disappointed.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like these headphones! I bought these mainly for running and vigorous exercise. I have other ear-buds, but those constantly fall out of my ears. I guess my ears are too small or something. With these I can run without worrying about them falling out. And to top that, they are also very discreet. You can't really tell I'm wearing headphones or at least you won't realize it at first glance. Also these headphones don't cancel sound out which is perfect. I need to hear my surroundings (I don't want to get run over or something).</td></tr><tr><td>I like my new Sony earbuds.  I especially like the extra length of wire.  It's nice having an off/on switch on them - I wish it was positioned a little lower on the wire but hey, you can't have everything!</td></tr><tr><td>50 cent is the most garbage rapper ever period, he has no poetic jesture, no lyrical content. after destroying ja rules career he comes out wif songs like lil bit and candy shop is real sad. i dont noe why 50 cent even went at nas. hes not even on his, level nas will kill him just like he killed jayz. if you really listen to rap and ur not no fake p*ssy u would not buy this garabge album.  not one song in this album is classic it has a couple of catchy songs.  2pac is the best rapper to pick up the mic, a legend in his own rhymes. buy his album and dont even consider this trash album trust me.</td></tr><tr><td>I would like to see the different sections of this toy be \"pieces\" of the puzzle, but its only the middle section.</td></tr><tr><td>I really liked the audacity of this film, and its thematic richness. But it ultimately didn't quite work for me. There was something unwieldy and graceless about the whole thing; too many scenes suffered from a distractingly awkward melding of serious and comedic elements.I tend to like challenging or quirky films, cinema with the guts to defy conventions. So there was much in this movie to keep me watching. I only wish my enjoyment of it hadn't been interrupted every few minutes by another clumsy ill-conceived scene.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this to help with lower back stiffness from years of long distance running and working out.  This is simple to use and really works well.  I noticed a big difference just after using it once.  I used it on the second level the first night and when I woke up the next morning my stiffness and some pain had diminished significantly.  I use this about about four times a week for about ten minutes before going to bed.  I so some lower back stretches when I am done.  I feel so relaxed, like a euphoria sensation.</td></tr><tr><td>the color as a semi perm bleeds, it bleeds everywhere. I was in the gym and my sweat looked like blood running from my head, my pillows are permanently stained with the ting of red/pink. not cool. I would buy the Joico again but only in a permanent color.Delivery was on schedule and even earlier than expected, I would certainly purchase from this seller again.thanks</td></tr><tr><td>this chair is definitely poorly made.  the pieces doesn't fit tightly together.  the color is nothing like the picture.  it is a very dark color.  ok for price, but buyers beware of these 2 factors.</td></tr><tr><td>it looks like what it should be. I haven't used it yet but it seems to be well made and the various parts are what they should be.</td></tr><tr><td>This is the first camera bag that I have bought as I start my career as a photographer and it is good for know.  There are enough pockets and compartments for my dSLR, flash, lens, and my Point and shoot camera as well.  I also have stashed in it my extra memory cards and batteries.  It has a dedicated tripod strap that is on the underside of the pack.  The outside \"light jacket holder\" is a joke and it appears to be more for decoration than anything else.  I would have like to have small zipper pockets for my memory cards instead of the elastic pockets.</td></tr><tr><td>Really like this bottle. The cap fits nicely so that even if the sipper nozzle is open, water won't spill out. Top is a little small though--it takes the bottle a while to dry out completely. Otherwise, I'm really glad I purchased it--will definitely come in handy, and has nearly payed for itself (expense saved from buying bottled water) after a couple of weeks.</td></tr><tr><td>That's a great deal, I bought from amazon.I like to buy another one. This is has good quality and good mater2.</td></tr><tr><td>I love trying on wigs, but I don't get the chance and normally you find only bad and horribly styled wigs for the price I got this wig. I Love wearing it, friends have commented on how real it looks, both in picture and in person! :)I'd buy more wings like this one when I want another.</td></tr><tr><td>I like everything about the case. Well build in every way Love it, and I recommend this case.... five stars!</td></tr><tr><td>Cutting is a breeze with these shears.  The length of the blades was disappointingly short, though.  I had expected them to be large enough to shear chicken wings and the like but they struggle to fit many broccoli florets.  Think more of cutting herbs than chickens and you'll be quite pleased with these sturdy little shears.</td></tr><tr><td>I like this product, it's affordable and lasts long - stress, weather change etc cause dryness and very uncomfortable sex. I've used this for a year with my boyfriend, no strong plastic odor, and it's not too sticky and more importantly it feels good! The tube lasted a year with occasional to frequent use.</td></tr><tr><td>This was a waste of money. It didnt work. It smells like its burning the internal circuit board and just garbage design. Parts do not fit together right. Wires are routed poorly. I would not recommend wasting your money on this.</td></tr><tr><td>It is good product, and it is the one I was looking for. I like it. 5 stars all the way... Also, it looks cool...</td></tr><tr><td>Bought this for looking for air leaks around the house.  Checked it against freezer and windows, seems like the readings are accurate.  Good for the job I'm using it for.</td></tr><tr><td>We really like this feeder. The quality of the wood is great (holding up just fine through winter snow and spring rains so far.) The pull out screen for cleaning is a very nice feature (especially since the raccoons feel the size of this feeder is perfect for sitting down in while eating all our bird seed.) The legs though, are a bit dodgey.</td></tr><tr><td>First off, with the name like Gevalia, you would expect decent coffee... granted many aficionados stay away from this, but I am what I like to call, middle of the road.  I have had great coffee from \"cowboy style\" to being served Colombian coffee in South America...  traditionally I like Peet's, Starbucks, and Dunkin (yes, I like their coffee also)... and for home brew I use Community, Dunkin, Starbucks and Gevalia...So when I got the Chocolate Mocha from Gevalia, I have to say... no thank you ... first off, it does not come close to a mocha.  I cant explain the taste, but it tastes un-natural.  yes, smooth, not bitter, but it does not taste natural, nothing like a coffee blend should be.I tried it dripped, in a solo kcup in my keurig... hot to over ice... with and without sweeteners... and still there is a bad taste .  I tried, I really tried.I love my Gevalia Colombian and Traditional / House blend Coffees... but really disappointed with this Chocolate Blend.</td></tr><tr><td>I feel like his decanter is the perfect gift for someone who likes to add a little class to anyone who has a home bar.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like leather belts. They are dependable and don't wear out quickly, especially for my size. I also have different belt buckles that I like to wear, so i want belts are not sewn together. This one fits the bill. Not too fancy, the finish is not too shiny and the leather is supple. It is not too wide for my khakis and looks great. I am very pleased.</td></tr><tr><td>The size is perfect for our small bedroom and it was easy to install and use.  I will agree with others that it is a little noisier than we would like and the beeps when changing any setting will wake you from a dead sleep!</td></tr><tr><td>The only way I can get this now is online. I got hooked on it a long time ago and now this flavor is not in the stores. This and Fruit Punch are really the only two flavors of Crystal Light that I actually like, but the other poster is right that the flavor is too strong for its suggested ratio. Usually I will fill a glass with ice cubes and some water before adding from the pitcher and that makes it palatable for me (and also keeps me from having to make a new pitcher every other day). This drink is perfect for those who want something refreshing and LOW IN CALORIES, but hate water. It's also nice avoiding caffeine withdrawals since I prefer it over soda.</td></tr><tr><td>I feel like a new man after using this.  It comes with little packets that are ready to go which makes it a little more convenient.  I feel like I have been breathing beach air after using this, very refreshing.  Also good to use before you go swimming to get the crud out of your nasal passages so you dont look like a booger monster when you come out the water! Akkkwaaaarrrddd....</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this for a large caliber handgun round 50 sw it works like a champ, I would suggest when the bullet drops into the chamber you pull it ou through the rear of the collet i found it to be easier, I read somewhere in the reviews this will pull a 50 bmg it will not</td></tr><tr><td>This forearm installed quickly and easily by using the included tool.I'm not a huge fan of the way this looks on the gun, but am not overly worried about the aesthetics either. I DO LIKE the ability to attach short pieces of rail to the forearm, and thereby attach a light to my shotgun. I'll note that the design helps provide a positive hold and works well when cycling the gun under time pressure.I DO NOT LIKE that this forearm extends further forward than the factory stock, so it is obstructed when using the Scattergun Technologies Side Mount Sling Plate, preventing the slide from moving all the way forward and keeping the action from locking closed. Either device works well, but they do not work well together.</td></tr><tr><td>I really liked this spray at first,  but like some other reviews have mentioned: it hasn't been working as well with passing time. For the price (around $10) I was hoping for a better product. It smells great and I still have 1/2 a bottle left, however I find the rapid dry polish to work better for me these days.</td></tr><tr><td>I LOVE this pointer. I bought it for my thesis presentation and it worked like a charm! It is handy and it fits perfectly on the hand. Also, the seller sent it right on time!</td></tr><tr><td>My dog couldn't get enough of this toy. He got so quick at pulling the squirrels out that we started to put toys in it that were harder. He lost interest when we did that. So we put the squirrels back in and he was back at it! He is a 130lb rottweiler and carries this little squirrels around like they are his babies. I would highly recommend this toy!</td></tr><tr><td>I flew with Hawaiian Air and American Airlines and had no problem using my baby's flight vest. He is 9 months old and we flew from Hawaii to Texas.  The only thing about the vest is it is hard to use unless the baby is sitting in your lap or sleeping in your lap.  My son fell asleep in the seat next to me but he couldn't turn around with the vest on connected to seat beat.  Would still recommend this because I like to be as safe as possible.</td></tr><tr><td>I like the soap.I don't like the brush.The cup is ok.Get what you pay for.</td></tr><tr><td>First of all, if you don't like musicals you shouldn't buy this. But since you're reading this you probably have some sort of idea what buying this cd would imply so whatever.Personally, my favorite track on this entire CD would have to be the suite to &quot;Hush&quot; but that's only because of the fact that I'm always doing homework while I'm listening to it so I always get caught unexpected during the screechysounds.But anyway this CD is an excellent buy and it's good especially if you want to spend the money for it.  If you can buy a copy with a slightly lower cost, I say go for it but it's an excellent CD either way.  Better than a lot of CDs I have from musicals on broadway.Although I definitely need to say that while the singers weren't all that great they were better than would be expected for random people from TV.  And you can tell it wasn't all faked cuz half of the people sound umm sorta bad.  Oh well.It's excellent anyway.</td></tr><tr><td>My cats won't use this for scratching; it's not stable enough for that ; it slides around.  They also demolished the toy -- ripped the feathers out, tore it off the pad, and pulled it apart.  I threw away what was left of the toy.  That said, the mat is nice looking and the cats do like laying on it.  I'm considering getting a second one for them.</td></tr><tr><td>but hover over photo  and see 7&#34; printed across bag??doesn't make sense, looks like a scam as the bag is 19.99 for leather</td></tr><tr><td>i like this product; i was trying to buy just a refill bottle the the big kit you get from costco.  this was as close as i could find</td></tr><tr><td>This face cream was very light and soaked into the skin quickly. I prefer a thicker consistency, but product when rubbed under my chin, and around my laugh lines, after drying, I could feel a firming and tightness.  Prices by Avon are so affordable compared to pricey products like perricone.  Will always come back to the Avon line!</td></tr><tr><td>It lets more light in and certainly gives a new feel to the bath. The tree looks more pixelated than hoped, but all in all I regret nothing. The photo makes it look transparent and it is not. More like a very light white color.</td></tr><tr><td>I think I should have gotten a larger size. It comes with instructions and is easy to use. I just have large calves and a wide foot, I went by shoe size like instructed but I should have known better. I am still using it as is and it is GREATLY helping me.</td></tr><tr><td>These sheets are heaven on earth. Last time I slept in any sheets like this was in London, England 30 years ago. I wish all the sheet sets would come with 4 pillow cases and a couple shams. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. It washed easy and dry it in the dryer on super low. I don't want to get out of my bed anytime I crawl under these sheets. Hats off to the place that makes them.</td></tr><tr><td>I absolutely LOVE this device. I have a large shower (4'x7') with lots of small (2x8\") brick shaped tiles. I used to get on my hands and knees with a grout brush to clean in between all the crevices. As you can imagine, that is a long sweaty chore and one I admit I did not do as often as I wanted because it was such a chore. With the shower cleaner, it has kept my shower sparkling clean after every use, including the chrome and curtain!It has exceeded my expectations and is obviously way cheaper than a maid, which I'd considered. I can't say enough how much this device has improved my quality of life (might sound like an exaggeration, but you haven't had to clean my shower!). VERY Satisfied!</td></tr><tr><td>I like how Ava is pink and has a cute yellow bow on her head.She is soft and durable like the other sock monkeys from the limo.Personally, I think the hands and feet are a little stubby  and i think they should have made them a little longer.Nonetheless, she is cute with her little purple dress. Little girls will love this one.</td></tr><tr><td>This was the second loose Nyx shadow I purchased. I liked the first one so I picked up a gold colour for summer. I love the way these look on but I still don't like the packaging.</td></tr><tr><td>I am so sorry I didn't like, It did have a lot of bubbles and it made my phone look Dirty.</td></tr><tr><td>I love my all clad colander!  I like the large holes. It makes it easy to strain the liquid. The only thing that I dislike about it that it is a bit heavy.</td></tr><tr><td>I like it .  Made better then the one I got when I was little.  It was a good buy.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchase this case for my daughters phone and she really like it.</td></tr><tr><td>Dont waste your time. You'll have better luck with a plastic bag. These things are terrible. Save your money. I have no idea what they mean by \"feel likes nothing is there\" because it definitely feels like something is there...like hmmm maybe a plastic bag!</td></tr><tr><td>These are genuine Dewalt batteries. They charged up and worked just like my old ones did when they were brand new. The price was right and the product is exactly what I needed to get my projects done.</td></tr><tr><td>I have to buy steel straws because my cats love to steal my plastic straws and chew them up.Make sure that you get the cleaning brush with it. Using that the straws are easy to clean. Some people might not like the feel of the steel on their teeth but it didn't bother me after drinking lot of it a few times. Anyone that loves straws will love these!</td></tr><tr><td>In traditional landscape mode, these filters work just like they're supposed to.  However, if you prefer to rotate your screen to portrait mode like I do, they become less than useless.  The screen can be seen from just about any angle, except sitting right next to the user, and the screen is darker, but without any privacy benefits.</td></tr><tr><td>It was what I paid for.  I like to listen to books on CD.  I purchased an inexpensive portable and that's what I got.  I should have spent more and got something better, which I later did.  It was just not what I expected.</td></tr><tr><td>Everything was ok. The Toby Tram Engine is excellent !I offer it Everybody who like Thomas and his friends!</td></tr><tr><td>A belt like this would cost you around 100 dollars and for the price and the quality this seller has it is just amazing, no more words.</td></tr><tr><td>Like the extra little bit of height, pads are comfortable, easy to assemble and disassemble for traveling. The rubber on the bottom helps with traction too.</td></tr><tr><td>The fuse box was a perfect replacement for the original block in my 99 model Blazer bass boat. It has more spaces than the original which I needed for add on accesories but same brand as original block which has lasted eleven years in both fresh and salt water enviroments. It is well built exactly like the original block. Fuses fit snug as well as the spade connectors. Very good product over all.</td></tr><tr><td>My granddaughter was really excited with this doll, so were we.  The only thing we didn't like was the doll didn't have any underwear.</td></tr><tr><td>This could just be me but I am used to the Triple X Factor Extreme where it had a little more margin of error. Where as this ball seems to either like the left side of the pocket or come up flat if depending on speed. There are a lot of factors that could be at play here like the person that I had drill the ball or my throwing style but I just have not had a ball that had a line like this one. If I throw it from board 1 towards the pocket at a little faster speed it seems to be best for me but not very ideal for me.Ball is very nice though and I did get a strike with it on my first throw.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this expecting only one decal. I was surprised when I received several of the decals in different sizes. I like them  a lot and they get 5 stars.</td></tr><tr><td>I like to wear this mostly when I'm having a bad hair day.  It took a good little bit of time to come, but overall it fits great and I am satisfied.</td></tr><tr><td>The cat was a little reluctant getting into the bag, but once he was in there he didn't complain.  I'd know if he didn't like it because he's very vocal about things he doesn't like.  I've left it on the floor since to see if he'd lay in it like the other reviewers mentioned.  I just don't think my cat is a box cat.  He doesn't seem to lie in any other boxes I've set out for him either.</td></tr><tr><td>I like this white tea, but there is nothing spectacular about it. I have had better tasting white teas in the past, but this is a good deal.</td></tr><tr><td>If you are looking for large storage and easy retrieval, this is the drive for you, plain and simple!Pay no mind to the people who buy it for 'Game Consoles' as I feel it was not designed for that, and I doubt these people assemble their own systems as I do.Shortly put, it is for mass storage and backing up large files, like pictures and especially video, which is why I got it.Western Digital My Book Essential 2 TB USB 2.0 Desktop External Hard Drive WDBAAF0020HBK-NESN</td></tr><tr><td>Seems to have very good suction power and it rolls really easily.  I have only used it twice so I do not know how it will hold up.  A couple of things that I think would be an improvement:  First, the accessories do not stay on the machine.  They keep falling off.  They need another system of holding them.  The electrical cord retracts well but I do not like that it is down near the floor.  I would prefer that it was up near the handle so that I could hold it while I vacuumed and less likely to run over it.  The attachment hose is really too short to be of much use.  It does extend out but as soon as you turn it on, it wants to shrink back to the storage size.</td></tr><tr><td>Hey, so seller will get that right to you.  Its a first time using product, but anything advanced nutrients puts their hands on, is as good as gold.  or blue. or purple, whatever you like.  Ill be back.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the job! I like the metal knob that is moveable to different areas needing stretch. It creates more \"give\" then just the wood shape.</td></tr><tr><td>These bulbs appear a little whiter more like a halogen bulb, or about 3000k.  Looking at different colored objects under these bulbs vs standard bulbs, colors are slightly brighter looking.  Otherwise I don't seem to have a color preference for lightbulbs as I don't really care about such a small difference.  I do just fine with standard bulbs.  I do find they are dim and needed to get 75w to use in place of 60w.  I got a pack at Wallyword for $2 just figured I'd try them out.  I give them 4 stars just because they are lightbulbs and they make light as I expect, and I haven't had any early failures yet.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a very good looking machine that you can be proud of leaving on your counter top. It does a great job cutting soft flexible things like vegetables and meats.  In fact it can cut these paper thin.  However, it leaves a lot to be desired when slicing bread. Sometimes it bread catches under the blade, and the machine has to be stopped and cleared.  Sometimes it stalls and blows it's fuse when cutting a crust. And sometimes, it's just not big enough to handle larger loafs of bread.  It's not easy to clean, and it's difficult to position a plate or the supplied plastic dish to catch the slices it makes.All in all, it's not so bad to make me send it back; on the other hand, knowing what I know,  I would be looking for a more powerful machine that is large enough to cut bread the size of the typical American white loaf.</td></tr><tr><td>I'm sorry but this doesn't work at all. I watched mice walk in and out of the trap. It's funny it's shaped like a home, because that's what it is for mice.If they're in your house, too bad for them. I wussed out. Now there's bait and spring traps everywhere.</td></tr><tr><td>It wasn't that expensive, so I wasn't expecting a lot. I got it for my husband for his birthday, and he really seems to like it. It's very sturdy and doesn't wiggle. It also is easy to transfer around because of the carrying case.</td></tr><tr><td>I usually used pampers cruisers but I changed this one.I like waist fit and price my boy likes the Mickey.</td></tr><tr><td>Made the switch over to glass with this bottle and I plan to buy more.  I have always liked Camelbak products but this is the best!  The silicone on the outside makes it comfortable to hold.  The water flows out just like the plastic bottles and the color is vibrant, attractive and easy to spot when I put it down and forget where I put it.</td></tr><tr><td>Led Zeppelin seemed to be going through a period of quiet hippie instrospection on this disc - most of it is ultra-boring acoustic songs you can't mosh to.  Nonetheless, there are a few highlights; they include:-The rousing \"Immigrant Song,\" a rocking tune indeed.  After this song, though, the hippie tunes come out in full force.-The gentle intro to \"Gallow's Pole,\" which unfortunately turns into a barnyard stomp best heard on the show \"Hee-Haw\" in the 80's.-The tender \"Tangerine\" song.  Robert Plant sure gets a lot of mileage out of a piece of fruit!-\"Hats off to Roy Harper\" is a psychadelic jam!  They should have included more psychadelia into the mixes of these songs.  As the Led III songs currently stand, they're about as dull as Jimmy Page's collaboration albums in the 80's - without the solo electric guitar!!My hope is that an exciting re-mix Led Zeppelin III album comes out soon, like Lincoln Park recently did with their hit album!!  They could add phat, Bizkit-type beats, and some rap overdubs to offset Plant's pathetic whining.  In my opinion, this is the only solution to remedy the sorry state of this dull record...</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this toy for my aggressive chewing lab. She put it in her mouth once and immediately put the toy down. She doesn't like the smell or the taste. If the maker could make the rubber smell and taste go away I think this would be an ideal chew toy for her.</td></tr><tr><td>I have a seven year old boy who has always been a builder, and he just received this toy for Christmas.  I was nervous about the material quality after reading other reviews, but was pleasantly surprised.  It is a thick, flexible plastic material of much higher quality than I expected.  We live in Wisconsin, and the cold does not seem to have an effect on the bumpiness of the track.  As for the difficulty mentioned in other reviews of making loops that don't wiggle, that is the part of it that makes it appealing to my son.  He loves to spend hours problem solving and using his arsenal of wooden blocks and other toys, our furniture, and anything else he can think of to make his ideas work.  This is why I gave 5 stars for educational value.  I knew he would like it, or I wouldn't have ordered it for him, but I am more pleased with it than I expected to be.  I plan on ordering the 24 foot track at some point.  In a nutshell, if your child likes to build and problem solve, this piece is a unique and interesting addition to their toy collection.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this item thinking it would be easy to sift and idiot proof with no strained arm or hand movements.  I guess it does that reasonably well, but I don't like the fact that you can't take it apart and thoroughly wash it, as you can't really submerge the whole unit due to the mechanics of it.  You can't wet the battery compartment, so you really can't keep it too clean.</td></tr><tr><td>I like having a track ball I can move with my finger versus a traditional mouse which required much more arm motion.  I spend hours working with this mouse without out the arm stress I felt before.</td></tr><tr><td>Weak, dry, tasteless coffee.  Doesn't taste even remotely like it was made with Columbian Arabica beans.  The grind was also of very poor quality.How bad was it?  This stuff makes Folger's seem like premium, high grade stuff.  I have no earthly idea how people give this Community Colombian Classico such a high rating.  Perhaps I just got a bad batch of very old stuff from Amazon but I'll not be giving this coffee a second chance!  Probably one of the weakest and most tasteless coffee beans I've ever bought.</td></tr><tr><td>i really like this shampoo it smells good and my hair feels great i think its cheaper on vitacost (around $4)i love that its organic im glad i made the switch</td></tr><tr><td>No good.  I love Garden of Life normally but these do not work as chewables.  It's like chewing a fish oil gel tab.  My three year old would not take them and after trying to chew one I totally understand</td></tr><tr><td>I needed bars that had a really high dose of protein. These bars have tasty protein-not dry and pasty like others I have tried. These fit the bill and taste great- I think! People that do not like them must be thinking this would be like a snickers bar or something. I use these when going on airline flights. I do not have to succumb to expensive airport food that is lacking in nutrition. I feel satisfied and full.</td></tr><tr><td>I am deployed to Afghanistan and I thought I would keep up my skills by buying a travel guitar. It sounds great for it's size and feels good to play. The only thing I can say I have against this guitar is that you must play it standing. It's almost impossible to play sitting down. I am thinking of a way to modify with guitar with a pillow or a bar so that it's easier to play while seated.Just like other reviews it is a little bit twangy, but it gets the job done. It's light, small, loud enough, and plays great. Get one if you're deployed, like playing everywhere you go, or you don't feel like carrying a dreadnaught around.</td></tr><tr><td>I'm very much into making my own products. But, I read up on this company and like what I saw. Not only do they not test on animals,  but, they send some of their profits to a great program. Also, impressive that you can read and actually know what the ingredients are.</td></tr><tr><td>I have a 2007 Macbook. I dropped it Thursday Morning at 3am. I ordered this screen Thursday around 10am, paid extra for 1 day shipping and had the screen the next day at 3pm. It took about 30 minutes to install using this video - [...]Saved me $650 from Apple. This version of the screen even allows you to continue using the dimmer buttons on the keyboard which I've been told that some screens don't work like that.</td></tr><tr><td>This movie is alright. That's it. Just okay. Mediocre. Because of all of the glowing reviews I thought it would be better, so I guess because of my expectations I was let down. I've been looking for a really good movie that shows footage of space and the planets that I could play through my projector at 12 foot wide. But alas, all I continue to get are 20 minutes of astronauts working out or floating around in zero gravity and 10 minutes of footage in space. If anyone has any suggestions for some jaw dropping planetary footage on DVD, please, by all means, let me know. I don't care if it's actual footage or computer generated (as long as it's up to date graphics).Three stars is fair for this video, but I wouldn't pay over ten dollars for it. This is way over priced for 37 minutes. It's like charging $20,000 dollars for a couple of bolts for the space shuttle. Ridiculous. I'm glad they've started to privatize space flight, maybe we'll actually see some real progress in the field of space exploration. Since NASA doesn't seem to be making any.</td></tr><tr><td>Hands down, the best shaving cream I've ever used. it only takes a very small dab to in order to spin up enough for a good shave. It is expensive but it lasts for a very long time. I think it's been something like 4 months since I bought this can and I still have 3/4 of the can left.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like the Paper Mate lead 0.5 refills! Writes very smooth! And the cost was a lot cheaper than in stores!! Awesome deal!</td></tr><tr><td>It's great for a short nose dog like a pug or french poodle but no good for long nosed dogs like mine.</td></tr><tr><td>Sound is ok but functionality stinks!!!  New firmware upgrade did not help at all.  Do not believe all the bells and whistles.  Pulling it out and returning it.  Like I said the sound is good but the technology is horrible.  There are better options.</td></tr><tr><td>I was actually surprised at how heavy and durable this star is. It's pretty rustic and authentic looking. I bought it for a co-working as part of an inside joke so I didn't want something that looked like a toy. The size is just perfect too.</td></tr><tr><td>Not gona lie, im picky to the CORE about brow pencils. Finally one made for blondes that doesnt make you look like a clown! Thank you maybelline and thank you to the company for getting it shipped to me so quickly!</td></tr><tr><td>We have lots of fun with these!  I guess they're a little small but I like the target challenge.</td></tr><tr><td>This CD is the best out from Sum 41.  None of the songs sound the same and there is a lot of variety.  There is alot of base and drumming.  Many of the lyrics to the songs are also quite amusing.  This is a good CD and I recommend that you listen to it first before you buy it, just incase you don't like their style.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like this cage ... well built and pretty easy to assemble ... so I'm very happy with it.  :))</td></tr><tr><td>I had such high expectations for this product.  It has absolutely no hold!!!  It did nothing for my braidouts and twistouts.  It was like I was applying water that foamed on my head.  NO HOLD!  No matter how much I used, or the way I used it........Nada.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought magnets before that looks exactly like this, but the magnet were so strong.  I cannot find where I ordered it. These magnets are so weak, they are technically useless</td></tr><tr><td>I bought these for my 18-month-old son, thinking they would be a good introduction to coloring.  It turns out that he was confused by the shape and had no interest at all in drawing with these.  He spent a few minutes turning the bottom, which releases the crayon, and then he was done.  I couldn't figure out how to get the crayon back in... crayons should not have moving parts and INSTRUCTIONS, in my mind!  I got some standard jumbo crayons and it turns out that my son likes those much better and will spend several minutes scribbling on big paper.  If you think about it, a toddler who is old enough to begin with crayons already has plenty of fine-motor experience-- picking up cheerios, doing puzzles, etc-- and doesn't need to be practicing the palm-grasp that these crayons are designed for.  They are ready for, and need to be practicing, the more standard way of holding age-appropriate writing implements like fat crayons and paint brushes.</td></tr><tr><td>This adapter will make your TLS APO look like a Nikon lens to your Nikon camera.  It seems to have a good quality build. It works as it should however, Since, It is a manual adapter, it has no electronic connection to the camera, as a result the modern digital SLRs will not recognize it and give an error message that the lens is not attached.  Some low end consumer models will not work in any mode other than full manual, and without metering help.  For  example if you use D3200 , the camera will not give you the exposure measurement and no indication as to the proper aperture or shutter speed.  Unles you have a light meter, you have to guse what the exposure needs to be.  Or do trial and error. Which maybe too slow for certain situations.  This is really an issue with the ALS APO system all together and not just this adapter. The adapter dose what is should.Another thing I noticed is that it dose not fit every camera perfectly,  with some cameras it has a tight fit but others very loose fit.  It is a bit annoying but it dose not seems to effect the image quality.</td></tr><tr><td>have only washed these linens a couple of times but so far, so worth it. unlike others, i've had no trouble keeping the linens on the bed d/t slippage (maybe related to type of mattress)  seems well worth the $ and had no trouble w/bleeding when laundering but wash me red ones w/like-colored loads.</td></tr><tr><td>The non-stick material, which is unlikely to be good for your health, comes off easily on this poor-quality wok made for \"Joyce Chen\" brand.  You may want to stick to a namebrand like Circulon.</td></tr><tr><td>This dry-erase board is easy to set up and use. It comes with magnets if you'd like to attach it to a metal surface, or two-sided sticky pads if not. The magnets attach to the sticky pads. I have not had the same issue as others with having poor-quality magnets. It has not fallen off my fridge once. It also comes with a combination eraser marker (the cap of the marker has an eraser on the end of it). The eraser works great with the included marker and writing/drawings/etc. are effortless removed. My biggest issue with this dry-erase board is that it just looks and feels awful. Between the gray surface and the plastic border, it just looks and feels extremely cheap and kind of sticks out like a sore thumb. If you're going to get a dry-erase board, I would really look elsewhere unless that doesn't bother you.</td></tr><tr><td>I have used these particular labels 3 separate occasions now and have not had a problem. I use an Epson inkjet and my printer loads and feeds them just fine. No multiple page loads or misfeeding. They have not curled and are somewhat thick, at least thick enough to do home postage for my eBay store. I do everything from #000 size package envelopes to large packages without a hitch! They are very sticky and won't curl, like some other merchants here are selling! Can't beat the price or quality for the price. Despite what a few people have said in these reviews Avery labels are overpriced as well as overrated! Buy House Labels @ about $.05 a label or you can burn money on Avery labels at 4x that!</td></tr><tr><td>but no instructions or suggestions.I was hoping this would have more guidance on how to use the pieces to make cards.I thought it was more of a beginners kit, but it isn't.It had a couple suggestions, like tearing the paper for different textures.But other then that, not much instruction.</td></tr><tr><td>I was pleased to be able to find a reasonably priced replacement for my QC2 ear cushions.  It only took a few minutes to put them in place.  It's almost like getting new headphones.</td></tr><tr><td>Haven't noticed it being better or worse than other lotions but it stinks. Don't like using it because of the smell</td></tr><tr><td>Bought a few accessories to go with this and my niece seemed to like them and for the price you cant go wrong.</td></tr><tr><td>These earmuffs were a great purchase. They fit my son perfect and they are really good quality. It's nice that you can change the band just by purchasing different colors although it slips off the muffs a little too easy. Overall I really like this item and would recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>This happened to be the second time I ordered Samsung OEM headphones via amazon and I've been happy with both orders! My old samsung headphones deteriorated and stopped working so I ordered some news ones from Simple Cell inc. The packaging was small, convenient, and simple. They were like how you would find them in the genuine packaging but with in a nice small plastic bag not much bigger than the headphones themselves. I was greeted with a friendly note from Simple Cell and tested the earbuds immediately and they did indeed  sound like the genuine headphones that'd you would get with your Samsung device. Will continue to order again whenever these break!</td></tr><tr><td>I was getting eaten alive on a camping trip last month.  Sprayed this stuff and within seconds it was like I had a barrier around me.  Good Stuff</td></tr><tr><td>This bronzer looks good. I like that it doesn't have shimmer in it. The only big downside is the price. It's a very small container.</td></tr><tr><td>Yeah, sure, it's light weight and virtually non-function.  But like chrome on a Harley, this accessory enhances the look of your ride.  I put it on a black 2010 Sequoia which in my opinion did not have enough factory (OEM) installed chrome on the front.  I have had numerous comments about how good it looks - all very positive.  It was easy to install and the price through Amazon was the lowest that I could find anywhere.  If you are into the aesthetic aspects of your ride, this is a winner.</td></tr><tr><td>I've bought this toy for my son. He loved it because it is very well made and so beautiful. Your children will like it.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this to hold my throwable life ring. It looks like good quality stainless steel and is the perfect size to mount on the back of my galley.</td></tr><tr><td>These soft big bears are exactly like the ones my dad and I used to get. They have a nice soft texture (not super chewy like haribo bears) and great cinnamon flavor. Highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>This little guy is adorable and very well made. No cheap plastic or paint mistakes, it looks just like the picture. Fits most stuff that has a headphone jack, including my Sansa MP3 player and 3DS.</td></tr><tr><td>Like all Speick products that I have tried, this is good stuff and reasonably priced considering that it is imported. The scent is bright and fresh. What can one say about shaving soap? It makes a rich lather and it smells good.</td></tr><tr><td>When my wife asked if I wanted to buy 5 crossbow bolts for $8 I thought \"wow! I won't find a better price anywhere!\". They just came in and after looking them over I can understand why they were so cheap. The tip and shaft are fine, but the fletchings and the nock look like they were assembled by someone who's never even seen a crossbow before. The fletchings are just slightly taller than normal crossbow fletchings, making the bolt sit funny in the rail. The worst part is the nock. The maker didn't even align them to the fletchings. this is kind of a safety hazard because in the best case they won't ever fly strait. worst case they jump off the string and go wherever the forces of chaos dictate. My advice: Instead of paying for 5 nearly worthless shafts, go ahead and spend your money on some well made, properly assembled bolts.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this as a Christmas gift but I use it more then anyone.  I like that it beeps when toast is done but I'm not sure why there's so much steam coming out of it?</td></tr><tr><td>I like that amazon has pictures of cakes so you can get ideas of what to do with the pieces. Out of the figures Meirda, Angus, and the brothers, Meirda was the best figure. It makes a really adorable cake for people of all ages.</td></tr><tr><td>Can't touch the price.  Shipping was quick and good quality, it fit the phone perfectly.  Wish it had a t-stand like my wife's case</td></tr><tr><td>If you like millet then this product won't disappoint.  Very tasty quality millet at a good price, I would order again.</td></tr><tr><td>It worked just like I wanted it to work.  I was very pleased.  Worth the money.  Safer and less expensive than a tanning bed</td></tr><tr><td>God! This girl sings about sex all the time. My humps, london bridge obviously referring to \"V\" between the legs, and fergalicious singing about how tasty she is. God Fergie you're almost in your 30's now. And yes i do remember Fergie back in the late 1990's girl group Wild Orchid which the gay audience are most familiar with. Even Madonna never ever wrote such classless cheap sex songs. Madonna's songs were more of the sexual erotic side. Fergie sounds like a Ho. She should put out songs that have more class.</td></tr><tr><td>Bounty is hands down the best paper towel. So thick, almost like a towel. Commercials don't lie. Love this product</td></tr><tr><td>This was the first time I have used this brand of tape and after reading so many other peoples reviews I was anxious to try it. I have used all kinds of adhesives over the years and this sounded like a must have. I love that it can be torn instead of cut and it seems to usually have great holding abilities. I was a bit surprised however when it seperated in a few places in a paper bag mini album I was making. I am going to order it again and recommend it. I'm hoping it was just a 'bad luck' spot. If it happens again then I may change my opinion but I like the convenience of it so far.</td></tr><tr><td>The leather & quality are very good and totally fit with the phonei like it too much and i advice BB Q10 users to buy this case.</td></tr><tr><td>I don't like dark color and it can't close itI like bright color it's too dark so I don't like it</td></tr><tr><td>The wood stock on my 870 Express was looking a little worn after a few seasons. I'd considered saving up for a Shurshot, or some other camo turkey gun, but this Hogue stock has turned out to be a fully satisfactory alternative. I REALLY like it. It was necessary to grind the stock down to close a gap between it and the receiver; other than that, installation was trouble-free. I love the new look and feel. I keep taking my 870 out of its case to admire it.  Fantastic!!</td></tr><tr><td>These don't grip well. Unless the trousers have a pronounced, thick hem at the bottom (like blue jeans) the pants will slip out and you'll have a pile in the bottom of your closet.(Updated) Finally threw them out in frustration. Waste of money.</td></tr><tr><td>Everything setup just like it should works with Air Recorder much cheaper then the Roland Brand which appears to be the same exact model.</td></tr><tr><td>I love this product.  It kept rain and snow and wind off my little one (born in December) and even though the little flap doesn't stay up all that great it didn't bother me.  As long as he was mostly covered, it was no biggie to me.  He was only outside for a short time, after all.  This was way easier than blankets, though, because it would stay on the car seat and not flop around or fall on the ground or anything annoying like that.  Not a necessity, but super handy.  Would recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>and the price is right! I like the fact that they can be shortened in the summer when it gets warm in the salon!</td></tr><tr><td>I was a bit dissapointed in the quality of the cover. You need to be very careful or it will rip very easily. It is clearly NOT leather and it does look like cheap plastic. It is a bit heavier than I expected and Not easy to store items inside. But you get what you pay for and this is the most unexpensive portable massage table.</td></tr><tr><td>Garmin does it again with a Top notch Product. Touch screen is responsive. Colors are bright and clear. I like the fact that it tells your what the speed limit is in any given area. Also the lane assist tells your all available lanes you can get in for an exit instead of telling you your exit will be on the right. Cars and navigation voices are customizable, most of which are free on Garmins website. Lifetime maps are a must to keep any Gps up to date!</td></tr><tr><td>Bought it for my daughter and her cake making excursions. She was thrilled and loves using it. She feels like a professional!</td></tr><tr><td>The ink is not nearly as dark as other compatibles. We didn't get any mail returned but it's noticeably lighter, more like a pink than red. The cartridge also didn't print as many stamps. In the past we've never run out of ink before multiple low ink warnings before the machine refused to print without a replacement installed. This is the very first replacement that has run dry even before the first warning that ink may be low.</td></tr><tr><td>After using this product, the area around the dog's eyes is stain-free. The dog does not like it, so we put it in a pill pocket. He weighs only 6 pounds, so I give him half the recommended amount.</td></tr><tr><td>I WISH THAT THE HANDSET HAD THE RED LIGHT MESSAGE INDICATOR ON THE IT LIKE MY OLD ATT UNIT HAD</td></tr><tr><td>Okay, everyone's opinions seem to be clashing on this particular anime, so I might as well put my two cents in. Do you dig anime/sci-fi with epic yet rediculous plotlines like stopping a war with songs of love? Do you like gundam/macross style space battles? Do you love the often stereotyped anime main characters? Do you wish more anime had soft edges on the characters instead of the sharp lines so often seen? Do you like cool backgrounds, japanese pop and (above all) long for an animated movie longer than an hour and twenty mintues? Look no further! If you are what I consider a true anime fan, you'll love this movie. It's got everything. Epic space battles, weird plot, cool backgrounds, japanese singing, sappy motivational speeches, and a really hot alien babe the story revolves around. Don't rent it, buy it!</td></tr><tr><td>If your tired of your name plate or lapel pins falling off because of those cheap backings then look no further. These backing go on and stay on until you release them. I have been looking for backings like this for a long time and now I have found them. I highly recommend this product.</td></tr><tr><td>This lipstick is so dry, it doesn't feel like any is getting on my lips. I really have to press down on it to get any color at all .. there is little feeling of moistness or any sensation at all. It might be an old tube?</td></tr><tr><td>I really Like this headphone. The sound quality is really good and the way that the actual earbud is posistion makes it really handy in the gym. The headphones won't fall out of your ears.</td></tr><tr><td>I'm shocked to find all of the reviews here stating that it doesn't jam.I've shredded maybe 2 bins full of paper and #1 it DOES NOT allow up to 17 pages, more like 7 and #2, only TWO business sized envelopes with paper in them (normal size, not stuffed full) have jammed it and now I can't get them out. I also can't find anything on the web to say how to get the jammed envelopes out.</td></tr><tr><td>It's hard to believe that I ordered a hookah off the internet for $10 (when most hookahs this size are at least $30), and it worked perfectly?It came brand new in the box (and I bought coals and shisha myself, of course), and the only thing that I didnt like was that there are no instructions to put it together. This is my first hookah. But it wasn't that hard to figure out. It was a really quick setup and started smoking easily. And it fits perfectly on my desk where I want it to be while I'm doing work on the computer. This is great. =]</td></tr><tr><td>Alrighty, this CD is absolutly THE BEASTIEST CD EVER.  Only so often can you find a CD that you can stand to listen to the whole way through, where every song becomes one of your favorites...well, this is one of those CDs.  From Girls, Fight For Your Right, Brass Monkey, Paul Revere and the News Style, Beasite Boys rock and rap it like nobody else.  You cannot say that you like the Beastie Boys and NOT own this album.  If you don't have it, BUY IT.  BUY IT NOW!</td></tr><tr><td>I think the title best explains it. I ran across this item as I was looking for baking sheets and now use it almost daily.It effectively replaces parchment and helps preserve the integrity of metalware while helping to prevent food from burning. Silpats are easy to clean, but it is difficult to remove oil from it, even those secreted by foods. Additional oil should certainly not be used.It's also worth noting that the Silpat is not appropriate in every situtation. For instance, breaded items have a tendency to become soggy, but it is perfect for baked goods like cookies, fish (a lifesaver, in fact), and other meats.</td></tr><tr><td>creamy blend of roses, incense, cinnamon and oriental spicesMy husband loves it.He sees a rich woman in a fur coat. It projects money he says.Money that comes in the family through generations.So, class and sensuality..I have tried it in the heat of the summer and did not like itbut now, in winter its wonderful. It seems like the colder it gets the better is the perfume.I have only had a sample-to pricy for me.</td></tr><tr><td>I thought the Plocky's tortilla dip strips were cut to a good size (not too big, which is usually the case).  Also, I was impressed by the fact that there are very few broken chips in each bag.  They have a good, typical corn tortilla chip flavor, although maybe a tad on the bland side.  I guess that is good if you like to dip them.  They aren't over-salted, nor are they greasy.  I do think they are just a tad too brittle, but really they are just fine.Personally though I still think that the various types of similar chips produced by Garden of Eat'n have more flavor and a better texture than this brand.  For strip-shaped chips like these, I've also tried several other brands that I thought were a little better too.  As I said, these are fine, but not the best.</td></tr><tr><td>Ok, this is obviously not the same as the traditional All Clad stock pots, if it was it would be more then triple the price of this one without the 2 inserts.  It is part of the disk bottom collection, however it is still top quality stainless steel and very well made.  I certainly would not consider it secondary.  It is a little lighter in weight than the traditional All Clad but it is not a light weight pot by any means. It is great for pasta, soup, stew, steaming veggies, etc.  You will love it and you can't beat the price.  It is very easy to clean and the inserts can be stacked and stored inside. A+Tip: If you should get something stuck to the stainless steel use a product called &quot;Bar Keepers Friend&quot; to clean it. Most supermarkets have it and Kitchen Etc. and Bed, Bath and Beyond carry it too. The container (like a Comet can) is gold with blue and white writing. All Clad recommends it for cleaning stainless steel and it works like a dream and is very inexpensive.</td></tr><tr><td>These mop heads are hard to remove and reinstall and they wear out after a very few uses. I like the mop to use but the sponge part over the years has become less and less durable and I am looking for an alternative.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like that they're color cordinated and individually packaged according to size. The kit was also a good price.</td></tr><tr><td>worth every penny. sound really good and feels like sound comes from the monitor when i place them on each side.</td></tr><tr><td>My cat was purring at my feet when I installed the cat dancer, however less than 48 hours later the toy is in cardboard tatters on the floor. Maybe that's a testament to how much my feline friend likes this product but she shredded it pretty quick. I would like to see the cat dancer toy portion be more durable.</td></tr><tr><td>My 12yo daughter happened to see the Vine program offerings and decided that our family absolutely HAD TO own a cupcake ferris wheel.  Well ok then.  It is as cute as you think it would be and works well, though I wish it could fit a whole dozen cupcakes.  It is also rather large, so think hard about where you might store this unless, like my daughter, you love it so much that you want it to be the permanent centerpiece on your dining table.  Bottom line, if you need a carnival ride for your baked goods, this is the one to buy.</td></tr><tr><td>If you have st.augustine grass just forget it . Clumps up every 5 second and handle very flimsey evenwhen all the way tight feels like it will crack at any time!</td></tr><tr><td>slightly slow but fully functional. I don't like when sometimes the watch faces change automatically, it's annoying</td></tr><tr><td>I like this, it's very cute and fun but I wish there was just a little bit more protection to it on the front.</td></tr><tr><td>The songs in her album are &quot;off the hook!&quot; Some of the songs, like &quot;Have You Ever&quot;, really can capture hearts and twist them around with a lot of feeling and Brandy has that kind of voice that can  deliver them into that person's heart!</td></tr><tr><td>This bed is very easy to set up and deflate. It met our needs very nicely, it was comfortable stayed inflated just like it promised. we love it!</td></tr><tr><td>Grip does not fit. I haven't had time to return. Instructions are not clear. Must have been packaged wrong from factory. looks like it will fit a round butt K-frame nodel. but certainly not a square butt N-frame.</td></tr><tr><td>This carb was purchased for a 1979 Yamaha motorcycle.  It worked surprisingly well, considering that it was just generically jetted.  Some fine tuning (jetting) is in order, but pleasantly surprised at how well it worked right out of the box.  As always, do your homework before ordering a carb like this to make sure it will actually fit on your motor</td></tr><tr><td>I got this shampoo hoping it will help with my thick hair, instead made it more frizzy, also the smell is more like a rancid honey, the shampoo is thick but the conditioner isnt and you have to use a lot in order to half work, it was a pure waste of my money!</td></tr><tr><td>It is ok and does what its supposed to do. It blends & cooks like advertised.As blenders go its near the top.</td></tr><tr><td>The parent steering is connected to the handlebar steering via two internal rods.  After two minutes of play, one of these rods disconnected, making the parent steering useless.  We called the company and they are sending a replacement part.  If that works out, we will be happy with the quality. The welds and plastic parts are ok.  The wheels are not rubber. They are a foam filled plastic that looks like it will probably wear out quickly.  Otherwise, we are happy with this trike.</td></tr><tr><td>I recently purchased this case for my iPad 4th gen - it is excellent! I don't like cases that feel too bulky or feel like they \"take over\" the device - I want a nice looking case that protects my product, but doesn't take away from the product itself - and this one fits the bill!</td></tr><tr><td>The quick setup instructions worked like a charm.  Most of my setup time was on the phone with my cable company getting them to register the new device by reading them the MAC identification number off the modem.  My internet speed is greatly increased since replacing the modem supplied by my cable company (Brighthouse cable) with this one.</td></tr><tr><td>Battery was a bit scratched up and what not but it's all good. The thing works like a charm !</td></tr><tr><td>Not even close to the picture, the picture might as well have been of a zebra.I am astonished that Amazon still has this seller on their website.What I received was a very cheap, flimsy hat with ZERO of the detailing of the hat in the picture. Nothing on theBrim, no patch on the front, no side vent holes. nothing, really????In fact even the bill of the hat is polyester, flimsy with no shape or form, and yes the hat was smashed, never to look like a hat again.Oh and this is supposed to be a Christmas Gift.And for $ 12.88 I thought it would look like a hat!!!!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>We like this chair because it moves around easily, height adjusts all the way down if we want to sit on the sofa and feed the baby.  Cleans easily.</td></tr><tr><td>I fly monthly on a small plane (2 x 2 seats). I have a 9 lb. terrier who fits perfectly under the seat in this carrier. The only problem is there are three mesh openings non of which have a turn down cover. I sewed on fabric cover on one and most of another so my dog was not stressed by being so exposed, especially at a scary place like an airport. But otherwise it is well made and perfect for flying.</td></tr><tr><td>I love the taste and the strength of the coffee. Perfect cup of coffee every time. I like my coffee strong but not too strong. Donut shop K-cups is good, but sometimes I like a variety.</td></tr><tr><td>I have been a long time user of Meguiar's Quik Detailer Spray.  It's cheap, available everywhere, and works.  However, after using Turtle Wax Ice Spray Detailer, I have found a new love.The Turtle Wax Spray Detailer costs almost twice and much as the Meguiar's, but the results are amazing.  The lable on the bottle claims that Ice does not streak, and that is indeed the truth.  After leaving work late last night I noticed the roof of my car was fogged up from the dew, and you could not see any streaking like with the Meguiar's detailer spray.  That's quite impressive as my car is black.The only downfall of the Turtle Wax Ice is that it doesn't seem to remove the water spots and splattered bugs from the car as good as the Meguiar's.  Other than that, the product is perfect and I highly recommend it.  I wish I could get my windows as streak free as my paint! (This spray is not recommended for glass).</td></tr><tr><td>Magnets I received were not as shown in picture.  The one thing I did like was that they were made of a rubber material that won't scratch, however, quality is only ok. The actual items I got had solid backgrounds - (2) blue, (2) yellow, (2) green and (1) pink with a raised gray trim and white lettering.  The day was only written on it once right in the middle. Overall not a bad item.  They work for what I wanted but I wouldn't have spent the money for the product I received.</td></tr><tr><td>This product is reasonably priced, and it does work, but BEWARE!The software disk that comes with it, like most media from China, contains a generous portion of VIRUS on it.After loading the ScanMaster program on my computer, I spent the next hour or so removing the Trojan Horse infections, and a variety of other spyware and adware infections. I ended up removing that program from my computer and finding another source on line for a bluetooth versoin of ScanMaster.It does what I needed it for (troubleshooting the Air Control Sensor on my 2002 Toyota Echo), but I don't recommend this for anyone who doesn't have a good Anti-Virus program on their computer.</td></tr><tr><td>I don't really know if it does anything or not. It doesn't give me a sick stomach like other products of this kind. I feed it to my vegan dog and her coat glows. Not sure if it's from this product. But....since DHA is necessary for optimum health, I figure it can't hurt us.</td></tr><tr><td>Good case that fits the unit well.  Gives access to all the points without removing the case to plug it in.  Would have like to seen it in different colors, but look is professional.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought the Chronicle SS matt black/dark tortoise design. Overall, the watch looks incredibly good; its black in color with a slight hint of tortoise colored band design, and the face of the watch looks pretty dark and cool. However, its visibility is not ideal in a dark environment. Not a big deal, after all a watch like this is suppose to be a fashion statement. I have been wearing the watch for a week. So far i have received tons of compliments.My biggest concern with this watch is its matt black coating. The underlying color of the watch is silver (or gunmetal), and a mild scratch on the surface will peel off the black coating and reveal its underlying color. I wore the watch for only a week and i noticed a few small scratches on the edge of the watch face. The watch looks durable, but its really easy to get a few scratches on it unnoticed.Overall, for its aesthetic and build, its still a good buy at $200+ price point, i would recommend it!</td></tr><tr><td>I really don't like this item, because it doesn't pull in and out very easy and it gets caught on the sheet and if your top mattress is not heavy enough it won't slide out. it's not worth the money. and you really got to make sure it locks in place.</td></tr><tr><td>Sylvania no longer makes the original bulb for  my lamp.  This replacement fits perfectly and dims just like the original. Hopefully it will last as long. Shipment was prompt and packaged well.  Glad that I can continue to use my German made lamp.</td></tr><tr><td>It doesn't make my face unshiny like I had hoped. But it does help to control my extreme oil problem. I apply it right after washing my face and I can usually get away with no powder until about 8 hours later</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered this thinking Green Mountain make great coffee and this might be one also. BUT IT SUCKS! It tastes \"like dishwater\" as my mom used to say. Very weak coffee. And the kicker is I can not return it. What a disappointment :(</td></tr><tr><td>I have suffered with constipation for years and I have had absolutely no problem with it now that I have added one tbls of this to my breakfast routine.  I have a few sips of water, then have the Carlsons, then my breakfast and follow that up with more water.  Then wait til I get to work, have a cup of coffee and then another glass of water and it works like a charm.  It's like night and day and I credit a lot of that to this product.  Plus all the other health benefits are great, too.  I highly recommend it!</td></tr><tr><td>I like the smell, my legs felt awesome using just this lotion everyday.  Just one week of use before I used the Epilator again.  Hair came out very fast and easy.Love it, will be buying more to keep using.</td></tr><tr><td>Snug fit at first and appeared to do the trick of keeping my 9 month old from pulling on her dresser drawers while climbing the handles to a stand.  But, she was constantly drawn to the locks because of the contrast of white on a dark surface.  What baby doesn't like contrast?  (so why all the locks in the world are white, I'll never understand).  After a few days of using the locks to climb on and smacking her head on the dresser, I ultimately left the locks unlatched and dangling.  New toy!?  She then decided she liked yanking on the loose locks and was able to twist the adhesive on the plastic backing.  The adhesive didn't fall off the dresser, it fell off the actual lock!  Removed the locks and said forget it, and suddenly the dresser isn't so interesting anymore. :)</td></tr><tr><td>I'm not a die-hard Fatboy Slim fan or anything like that.  I just know some of his songs and bought this CD mainly for those songs, such as The Rockafeller Skank, Praise You, Weapon of Choice, and Right Here, Right Now.  However, I found a couple other songs on this disc that I liked such as Sunset (Bird of Prey), Going out of my Head, Santa Cruz, and That Old Pair of Jeans.  Some of the songs were too repetitive for my taste, but that's just what you get in this genre of music.  Overall, I think it was a good buy, even if some of the songs were throwaway ones for me.  If you're a casual fan of Fatboy Slim like I am, this will probably be a good buy for you as well.</td></tr><tr><td>I like that it is wifi compatible, but it is hard to get enough upload speed to keep it operating smoothly. I am happy overall with the machine. Wish I didn't have to pay so much for apps to work it on my phone and tablet!</td></tr><tr><td>At first, I did not like the main character as I felt he had a bad attitude, but after I learned how much emotional pain he was in, I forgave him and fell in love with him.  This is such a feel-good story and it just reminds me what I already know is that you don't accomplish much in this world with the help of other people.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like this. It is long and fits over the sink and tall enough so you don't hit your hand while turning on the water. The only thing I would change is to have a finished wood. Otherwise this is great.</td></tr><tr><td>For me personally I do not like it.  I am all Italian and have olive skin and break out somewhat easily. This product made me break out, therefore I wont be using it again. Going back to Clinique serum. You get what you pay for.</td></tr><tr><td>it work very nice with my samsung blue ray player just like advertised and this is the second blue ray that i tried it and in both work flawless...very good item i recommended</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered this skin for my Sprint HTC Hero on a Monday and received it in the mail on Friday. It fits my phone perfectly. It's a very nice cover, looks just like the picture.</td></tr><tr><td>I adore these little jars.  They are like gleaming little jewels when filled with homemade jams.  Perfect to give as gifts (but they're so pretty, you may not want to part with them!).</td></tr><tr><td>This tea is absolutely wonderful! I'm not sure what the hibiscus is supposed to taste like, but whatever that flavor is, mixed with the blueberry, it is absolutely wonderful and delicious! there's a hint of both sweetness and tang, and while being a good way to jump start the morning, it's a great way to end the night. Heck, it makes my afternoons better too. I highly recommend this tea!</td></tr><tr><td>I looked for this specific mug to replace one that I accidentally ran over with my because I forgot it on my roof when backing out. I like this cup.</td></tr><tr><td>It eventually gets fruit crispy but it takes longer than I'd like.  And it gets pretty noisy.  But I would definitely recommend it. I mostly do fruits and jerky.</td></tr><tr><td>I have ot say that using the sonicare toothbrush and brush head is like going to the dentist every day.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought these to make a C&C; guinea pig cage, a use for which they aren't intended but still work very well. My guinea pigs have not escaped - and for those in the know, this brand has exactly the right number and size of holes per grids - and it offers ample opportunity to expand and rearrange their cage.The reason I gave four stars and not five is that there was no mention in the packaging I got of the force required to lock them together. I still haven't managed to lock them in, and so the cage snaps apart very easily. For the most part this isn't a problem, as the pigs are contained by a plastic box inside the grids, but it would be a terrible problem for someone building a second storey or just using them for their intended purpose as shelves. Because they make a clicking sound when they go into the connectors, and seem to budge no further, it's entirely reasonable that people would assume that they were locked in. They look like they're in, they sound like they're in, but they're not. I would have assumed they were defective too if not for the multitude of reviews online that mention the extreme force.All in all a very useful product with some information/assembly problems.</td></tr><tr><td>I don't have much to say about this except that first of all, it did not seem to have any effect on me, and second, like every one of those pills out there that make claims about what they do and do not do to your body, these claims seem to be made up entirely.My guess is that if you want to lose weight and add definition to your body, it's probably best to eat right and lift weights. There's no such thing as an easy way to a perfect body!</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, it is a good bike, but it has a few quirks.  It has no tension adjustment, and at 55 years of age, I wish I could reduce the tension a little.  The seat is too hard.  The bike is heavy and hard to move.  However, after riding it about ten times now, I like the smooth motion.  What I like I really like, but the few things I do not seem strange, like the designers of the bike did not test it themselves.</td></tr><tr><td>My daughter loved her orbeez..I however...I really didn't like it.  She only used it once and now it sits on a shelf</td></tr><tr><td>This is pretty similar to some other Play-doh kitchen sets, both in terms of strengths and weaknesses.  (For example, compare thePlay-Doh Magic Swirl Ice Cream Shoppeor thePlay-doh Burger Builder).Strengths: Like the other sets, this is a lot of fun for kids who like Play-doh and cooking.  It has a press that you can use to make pizza crusts, a grater for cheese, and a set of smaller molds for a variety of toppings.  My five year old loves it, and loves taking pizza orders, then making a pizza to share with her dad or her stuffed animals.Weaknesses:  Younger kids, especially 3 or under, may have trouble manipulating the set.  Also, as the other reviewers have pointed out, pretty soon your Play-doh colors will get mushed together, producing a bunch of cans of mottled brown and mottled green.  If your kids like getting color appropriate pizzas, each set of dough doesn't have much staying power.</td></tr><tr><td>These bands work very good .I like them. They are a little smaller then I thought they would be but they still work great</td></tr><tr><td>After much searching and reading reviews, i bought this lens from Amazon for portraiture and low light photography, and i have yet to be disappointed. It is such a good lens and produces sharp, clear photos with beautiful bokeh. And for the price, it's just a no brainer. Get it and you will probably won't remove it from your camera body.The ideal sharpness comes around f2.0 even though this lens is a f1.8, and since it's a fixed prime lens you will need to move around to compose your image, which i have found to improve my photography considerably.I have also managed to get some really good macro crops from this lens.Down the line i might trade this lens in for the 35mm variant just so that I have a little more room to move :)For now, I love this lens!!Cheers!</td></tr><tr><td>The product I received was like I expected. It had the flavor I was so looking forward to taste. I will always buy my Chai Tea here.</td></tr><tr><td>This game is very nice I like it very much but the wheel was broken upon delivery. My husband said the soldering came apart on the spinning wheel. He is fixing it. But other than that all of the other pieces of the game are very nice. My two grandchildren and I played four games today and it was a lot of fun.</td></tr><tr><td>I will buy more when I run out of these!!!!  I really like them a bunch.  Would recommend to anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>What a brilliant design. This stand enables you to position you iPad at whatever angle you like, both in portrait and in landscape mode.It is sturdy and the plastic is covered with foam in those spots where the iPad will touch the stand, so you won't have to worry about scratches. I use it for my Kindle too (though I wish they would make a smaller version especially for Kindle/e-readers).Love it!!</td></tr><tr><td>My Zagg Smartbuds fell apart repeatedly. Zagg's customer service offered me a discount on another pair but that's it. I've had to fix mine repeatedly. The last time they fell apart, the button was lost. I like that they loop around the neck but the way that the mic/volume controls are set up is terrible because it falls apart. The plastic around the jack has also cracked. Never buying from Zagg again, I don't recommend that you do either.</td></tr><tr><td>Diavlo was given to my 8-yr-old daughter for Christmas and she was extremely pleased (to say the least).  It's a cute stuffed \"animal\" - not sure of any \"learning\" value most stuffed animals have.  Try to keep it away from your dog because he might tear it to pieces.The Moshi Monster web site has some educational activities, but it can be a waste of time. Check up on the \"message board\" area to make sure your child doesn't \"friend\" any perverts (same as any other on-line or off-line activity).I should have bought one for my car to hang like fuzzy dice because it's pretty cute.</td></tr><tr><td>I like Natural Calm.  It seems to help me get a better nights rest when I take it before bed time.  I believe most of us do not get enough magnesium in our diet and Natural Calm seems to be a great way to remedy that.  It has a pleasant taste and it seems to all dissolve in hot water.  I purchase it regularly and will purchase again.</td></tr><tr><td>I like it but I don't know if it works or not.I think this is a good medicine.I just send in Philippines</td></tr><tr><td>I do like these trays and lids and use them frequently but wish they came in a larger size with deeper cubes as baby grows.</td></tr><tr><td>I've owned the Tivo Premier for 2 months and am extremely happy with it so far. I purchased it because I don't like paying a monthly fee to rent a DVR from the cable company when I can own a far superior product. I am however disappointed at the only one drive option for expansion, I would like to see competition for lower prices and higher quality, and also larger sizes. 2TB drives have been around for a couple years... let us have the big boys!</td></tr><tr><td>I love it very much.The price is excellent and lower than the price down home from a retailer.Fits like a glove but have to make 2 holes.</td></tr><tr><td>This cookie cutter looks like it was originally made for play dough and was adapted for cookies. Cookie dough doesn't keep the impressions of cutters. They look like round shapes not the animal shapes of the cookie cutters. But this package is great for play dough.Kids can make gifts for fathers day or just for any occasion. Would not reccommend for cookies.</td></tr><tr><td>Look, not going to lie, these are harder to chew and have a waxier material then starbursts. But personally, i like the subtle taste more and the flavors are more true to their fruit counterparts.</td></tr><tr><td>Best toaster I have ever had.  I love the cancel button and the frozen button.  It toasts like it should.So glad I picked this one.</td></tr><tr><td>Exactly what everyone describes. multiple devices, doesn't work. total ripoff - don't buy it. I was pretty disappointed, and I agree that it's not even worth the trouble to send it back for a return. Seems like it's a good way to scam people out of money.</td></tr><tr><td>I didn't like these.I guess it's my fault for not liking them, because I actually have never tried wasabi, but I like asian flavors in food and adore all of Blue Diamond's bold flavors, so when I saw this in the store, I was like hey why not.Now I know why not. These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads. The nuts themselves are high quality and always taste fresh, so at least I was able to get some use from them. However, I would never  buy these again and if you are not experienced with wasabi, you may want to think twice before buying them lol.</td></tr><tr><td>I do like that this product is organic, but it is only so so as a toy.  It doesn't really peak interest/ entertain the baby like I would have hoped.  Therefore it is a bit overpriced for the caliber of toy you are getting.</td></tr><tr><td>Works like a charm. Is heavy duty and well built, and is QUIET. Usually, the fan does not come on at all under light loads. Some other cheap brands turn on their noisy fans as soon as you turn it on, which many people say is annoying. The limitation with this unit, of course, is that it will only convert 12/24 volt DC to 600 watts AC. THAT IS ITS RATING, so don't expect it to be able to provide more than that. It simply cannot handle any type of heater, for example, since most small heaters are 1,000-1,500 watts. This is a great product for running lights, tvs, radios, computers, PDAs , phones, etc. it is a pure sine wave inverter, so no worry about it causing interference or creating problems for your computers and other electronics. Xantrex is a well known, dependable brand. Worth the price.</td></tr><tr><td>I used to like this product - it was cheap and easy to find.  However, every now and again after flat ironing my hair, I'd notice that my hair smelled like it was burnt and sometimes the smell would persist through a wash or two; it became a real issue.  It took a few months, but I finally realized that this product doesn't work as well as it says it does (or at least for me it didn't).  I stopped using it and switched to a higher quality (and much more expensive) heat protectant from Aveda about 6 months ago and I haven't had the burning smell come back once yet.</td></tr><tr><td>Works good for my 7 month old but it is really lightweight just like the product promises! If I spike his hair it stays put unless I have to put his hood on.  Smells nice and clean too!</td></tr><tr><td>It's a controller, if you like the PS3 style of controllers with both thumbsticks on the bottom then it's exactly what you're looking for. Caution though the triggers are super strong, and take a lot of force to hold down.</td></tr><tr><td>background: i'm using the protectors for both 'resistance' and the 'dc deckbuilding card game'.positives: the protectors fit perfectly both width-wise and height-wise. i feel like the cards are well protected against scrapes, sweaty hands, and rough handling.negatives: only reason why it's not a 5-star for me is because the protectors make the cards extremely slippery. when i hold the deck of cards, i have to be super conscious of how i hold them and how tightly i hold them. if i hold them the wrong way, the middle sections of the deck fly out of my hands uncontrollably.</td></tr><tr><td>My toddler likes to drink from a glass like the rest of us.  He uses a small pitcher to pour his milk into this cup.  It is the perfect size for little hands.  They are sturdy enough to withstand occasional hard placings by a toddler onto the table.  Cheap enough to replace... why wouldn't you want to let your little one feel BIG?</td></tr><tr><td>I have struggled with Bosch (lousy), Anco, and whatever Walmart is selling. These are the first wipers I have used that really work well even on a dirty windshield in light rain. After six months they are still working like new.  Strongly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>I've had mixed success with the Philosophy bubble baths, but once you find a winner, it's worth holding on to. After trying Vanilla Birthday Cake & a host of others, my first winner was CINNAMON BUNS. Cinnamon Buns is luscious and luxurious, and perfect for winter.I wanted something new for summer. I tried Melon Daiquiri, Coconut Frosting and Mimosa, I finally found SENORITA MARGARITA. It's a winner for a summer bath. I especially like this in an epsom salt bath after a long day gardening. The bubbles are long-lasting and the fragrance is fresh yet relaxing.I have another winner. My new favorite is SENORITA MARGARITA. Smells like the real thing too. :)</td></tr><tr><td>A nice two pack! I like these soft silicone cases because I think the soft case helps protect the phone if it's dropped and has some grip to it so it doesn't slide off tables and such. It fits well and looks pretty good. Not a great fan of the cover over the home button, but overall like the nice silicone feel to it. And the 2 pack is offered at a nice price.</td></tr><tr><td>Fridge is like brand new again , it used get frost over every 10 days or less. if you have A whirlpool Or kohler fridge that dosnt  defrost , yes check bimetal thermostat</td></tr><tr><td>Couldn't be any easier to install.  Although the product doesn't appear substantial, much to my surprise, it actually acts as a deterrent and my dog hasn't even attempted to interact with it.  She didn't paw it or push it or anything.  My dog use to get so excited on the way to the park that it was a hazardous drive to get there; she would paw me and stand over the center console and I had to drive with one arm while wrestling her with the other arm.  Now I just drive (stress free) and she sticks her head out the window like a normal dog.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this item based on the size advertised.  It is a bit too small.  I like the color, and I am using it; however, it slips off the couch.  I was wondering why it didn't have straps like the smaller ones.</td></tr><tr><td>Samsung chips are still the best choice. it is faster and easy to install, plug it in and play, I like to buy more</td></tr><tr><td>I like these because of the chocolate and that its one of the few chocolate cookies to which i have a minimal allergy.  I don't like them because they are dry and tend to crumble easily.</td></tr><tr><td>The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the construction of the HDMI cable isn't top notch like that of overly priced Monster Cables (fancy looking plug ends, extra insulation, etc...). But in all honesty, the construction doesn't matter. It's well made for what I paid for it and it does a GREAT job with no setbacks. There is no reason to spend more money on a fancy cable when this one does the same thing. It's a solid, well built, albeit cheap looking, cable that does the job it was intended for. It goes behind the TV so nobody sees it anyways. I'd definitely purchase it again with no regrets!</td></tr><tr><td>This second generation of the 7th Generation diaper is way better than the first version. It is now comfortable, non-leaking, close fit.Just like Pampers but not any better.The first version of this product was unacceptable. The latest version is an acceptable product but not superior or worth specially seeking -- or paying more for.</td></tr><tr><td>I love it! Very easy to carry and it protects my phone really good. Like the colors and design, nice.</td></tr><tr><td>It looked like they took at 2x2 picture and blew it up 50 times to create a very hazy reproduction. Terrible.</td></tr><tr><td>Had 2 cats with tapeworms and after using these pills they were gone. It also had to do with getting rid of fleas too as both seem to go hand in hand with each other. If you have a cat with worms this will work like a charm</td></tr><tr><td>I love the fact that this bottle folds up so small that I can stick it in my pocket or have little or no added weight to hang on my belt loop when full or empty.  I also like that it can stand when it contains water.</td></tr><tr><td>This soap is strange.  It is a thick black tar-like soap.  It is hard to get out of the container (without the pump) and doesn't smell all that good.  I didn't use it as a mask because I didn't really like it, so I have only washed with it.  It does a good job cleaning, the squeaky clean kind of clean.  But I didn't feel it did a spectacular job to make all the other cons worth it.</td></tr><tr><td>It's like a zippy sports car.  Smooth elegant stylishly simple.  It makes the food seem tastier.  Never been so happy to have a kitchen device!</td></tr><tr><td>a bit expensive but good quality and if you like ceramic there are not much choices. I actually had to flip it to the other side by enlarging one of the hole. like it so far</td></tr><tr><td>I like these for storing my electric toothbrush in a sanitary way. Only drawback is they break easily (particularly the part that holds the sanitizing powder).</td></tr><tr><td>its the best lens i have ever buy and i like the quality of the picture although it have wide angle and long lenght focal</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered this based on the photo showing a plug that could take a USB cord.  Also, the Australian plug adapter.  Neither were included in what I received.  I got a plug whose cord is fixed and no Australian adapter.  I suggest that photo be taken down.  I'd like a replacement or a partial refund, please!</td></tr><tr><td>I have a few of these Augmented Reality Puzzles and I absolutely love them.  The kids get a kick out of the app feature while I enjoy the awesomeness of these Ravensburger puzzles.  I love puzzles, always have, and I like an active scene.  I need color and variety in my puzzles and I get that with this puzzle.The size of the pieces and completed puzzle itself is a really nice size.  Not too big but not too big either.  They're just right for my dining room table which is where I like to do my puzzles.I like Softclick Technology of these puzzles.  It has a nice snap too it when you put the pieces together so that you know you have the right piece.  There's no wondering if a piece fits or doesn't.  If it's right, it goes together perfectly.  No guesswork involved.One feature that I think it pretty neat with this particular Augmented Reality puzzle is how you can insert your own picture into one of the billboards in Times Square when using the app.  It's pretty neat.I love these high quality puzzles and I would recommend them to my fellow puzzle lovers.</td></tr><tr><td>This sprinkler is so worthless, if I could I would have given in -5 stars!!  Hardly any water comes out....the actual product performs nothing like the picture on the packaging.  False advertising!!  Shame on you Banzai for disappointing children!!  What a dud.  Parents, do not buy this sprinkler for your children unless you want to ruin a perfectly fine summer day.</td></tr><tr><td>My son loves power rangers and just had to have this toy its what he wanted more than anything else for his birthday.  Toys R Us has it for a $100 more.  I like the toy and I like the price I'm getting at amazon I will be ordering more stuff from here.</td></tr><tr><td>This dress was more like a trench coat. Had to wrap it around and keep it closed with the belt. VELCROs closed, be sure to have some pins on hand if you plan to wear this out of the house. Faux fur shed all day long. Overall, there were better dresses.</td></tr><tr><td>The purple is more of a pinkish color but it's still cute fits like A glove and protects my phone</td></tr><tr><td>I gave this three stars because it tastes absolutely awful.  I am great at handling adverse flavors.  If this were to taste like dirt, like a couple other commenters said it did, I would have been delighted.  But the one flavor that makes me gag is artificial sweetener.  It is sweetened with Stevia, not artificial flavors, but nonetheless it taste like liquid sweet and low.  The sweetness is overpowering and it is the only flavor I taste.  It is awful.Also, this was my first time ever trying Kava and I noticed my heart acting very strangely.  I used it for my insomnia, and while it definitely calmed me and let me sleep, my heart was beating very hard and irregular.  I have an irregular heartbeat as is, but taking this seemed to worsen that considerably.  I could hear my heart beating through my chest while I was trying to sleep, and it was a bit disconcerting.  Something to be weary of if you have heart problems, or just an irregular heartbeat like myself.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this recently in the USA as getting electronics where I live is very difficult.  I had it delivered through Amazon.  So far, it hasn't been very helpful.  It will not recognise blank DVDs at all, which makes it sort of pointless for me.  It just won't recognise that there is anything been inserted.  If I put in a DVD that has been erased, it says that it is locked.  It crashed my computer after this incident. It does accept non rewritable CDs which is OK, but not what I wanted.  It also does weird thing like cause random windows to open.  I found the instructions unhelpful and the disk that came with it made no sense as everything seems to be in Japanese/Chinese/Korean (I apologise but I can't tell the difference between the languages in writing).  I'm sort of at a loss and starting to consider it a waste of money.  Sorry to say that I can't recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>The product was not what I expected. When I saw the product online it looked like a real Iphone. However, when I got the item it looked like a cheap toy.  You can tell the flask is not really an Iphone. I was not really happy.</td></tr><tr><td>This stand is really good for large books, like albums or something like that. However it does take up a lot of space and therefore it's too much for anything smaller and when I tried it with my 14\" laptop it didn't hold very well. Maybe something like a tablet would be a better fit...</td></tr><tr><td>It's an awesome watch at this price point. Exactly as shown and described by other users. One thing I would like to point out is that you can really tell that the case and bezel are chromed plastic in real life. It's not really a bad thing, it just doesn't look like stainless steel as the item description states it is. You can see it in the pictures but I didn't pay it any mind when I ordered. I am still very happy with my purchase and would recommend it.My thoughts on the band: I really like the adjustment feature. I have never seen this type before and was able to figure it out fairly quickly. there is an arrow on the clasp that indicates where to insert a tool (pen, knife, screwdriver, anything pointy and sturdy) and lift. Once the lever is lifted you can move the clasp to wherever you need and reclose the lever to lock it in place. In my opinion, this is way easier than removing/adding links.</td></tr><tr><td>I like this product and have used it for the last 6 months with my baby.  It doesn't float, it sits on the bottom of the tub that you have filled with a bit of water and gets totally saturated like a big warm sponge.  You rest the baby on it and he lays on it comfortably without slipping around.  It is made of fabric and some sort of poly stuffing and when you are done with bathing you can hang it up with the plastic hook that is attached to it so it can dry.  I haven't had any problems with it at all.</td></tr><tr><td>It's kind of hard to tell on this web site which toothbrush is the \"original Oral B\", but this seems to be it.  Packaging that looks like \"Oral B\", Extended brissles on the tip, color coding for wear and a neat special center for better polishing (new).This seems to bethe real \"Oral B\"!</td></tr><tr><td>This is the ONLY probiotic that works for me to \"cure\" my IBS. I recently tried another, less expensive brand, and my IBS came back. I forgot what IBS feels like. It's awful. When I take Flora 50-14, I have no symptoms whatsoever. It's like I don't have IBS at all. I will never switch again. This product is worth every penny and is truly a godsend.</td></tr><tr><td>This took my about 2 hours to install with help from a You Tube video. I am a novice car guy with basic tools and this handle had no plastic parts in it like the original stock handle does. Much better part.</td></tr><tr><td>Though people say Christina Aguilera &quot;learned&quot; to properly sing these songs, I think she actually does have some Spanish speaking skills, because she sings in the language with such accuracy. In my opinion, &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; has to be Christina Aguilera's best work. Even if you don't speak Spanish, (for instance, I'm taking French), it is still great just for the listening enjoyment. She adds all her hits, plus some new material. My favorite Spanish remake has to be &quot;Por Siempre Tu&quot; (I Turn To You), and the title track &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; (Reflection). You will also enjoy the more upbeat, catchy dance songs such as &quot;Falsas Esperanzas&quot;, and &quot;Cuando No Es Contigo.&quot; &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; features some BEAUTIFUL ballads such as &quot;Contigo En La Distancia&quot;, (my favorite ballad), and &quot;Pero Mi Acuerdo De Ti&quot;, as well as a duet &quot;Si No Hubiera Conocido.&quot; This CD is a must for Christina Aguilera fans, or just pop music fans alike. Like I said, you won't be able to put this one down!!</td></tr><tr><td>I used this to re-ink two stamps and it worked perfectly - without any spillage or mess.  Re-inking was easier than I could have imagined.  The price was also really good.  I'd recommend this item for anyone still using stamps like I do.</td></tr><tr><td>I put this little gadget on my knee scooter  Turning Leg Caddy - Black - Tall Size 5' 8\" to 6' 6\" - A14723 04 and have found it really handy. It is well-conceived and well-executed. It does a good job holding onto not only things like cans, but securely holds glasses of fluid. (Of course, without a lid, stuff can still spill if you hit bumps, but that's not the holder's fault). It's also handy for carrying things like keys, or small amounts of cash or a credit card, etc., when you don't have pockets handy to do so.</td></tr><tr><td>The adhesive on these Velcro squares really holds.  I use them on small items like straps and belts.  I also put them on the sides of my tv to hold strips of poster board to cover up the annoying crawls on so many stations.</td></tr><tr><td>dont bother it was a b*tch to get to seal had to buy a can of $17 gasket maker because it kept leaking, then it looked good this summer but the first winter its been on(not even through it yet) and its all rusty and looks like s***, just gonna wait till i need to change my diff fluid again this summer and paint the original red or something and put that back on, or maybe buy the chrome cover from LMC it probably is better quality</td></tr><tr><td>I hope when I have to replace the bar this works like the 1 that came with the smoker . I ordered to have on hand in case needed .</td></tr><tr><td>This product was not as sturdy as I thought it would be but otherwise I am satisfied with it.  It is serving it's purpose and my cats like it.</td></tr><tr><td>I had the G9 for years and loved that camera so much.  It was time to upgrade to HD Video, so I did and finally sold my G9 on Amazon, and went after the G15.  I don't like it, I don't use it, I am not sure I ever will.  It's so different from the G9.  I shouldn't have sold that camera.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought these as an alternative to Swiffer refills which are expensive.Unfortunately, so are these. There are better generic Swiffer refills that are much cheaper.  I like the smell of these but there's no scrubby strip so you can't really get stuff that's caked on.  All in all they're ok for everyday use but you can't get the floor very clean with these.  I like the smell but honestly you're better off using a squirt bottle with vinegar and rubbing with a paper towel.  It's cheaper and does the same thing.</td></tr><tr><td>I didn't see these in Grave of the Fireflies, but actually ate them frequently as a child. They're still as tasty as they once were, though I'm given to understand these have HFCS rather than simple syrup and might not be a traditional recipe.The cans can be a bit annoying to open without a tool of some kind, as the cap is installed pretty snug. Inside, there are about twenty or so candy pieces dusted with sugar. You have strawberry, grape, orange, I think cherry, lime and a 'green' flavor - melon? There's also two kinds of mints. Some bottles came with more mint than others. I feel like the flavor clash is pretty significant, so a fruit-only version would be something I'd probably like better.The flavor is sweet and just slightly tart. Much less tart and sour than say, Charm's Sour Balls, and less sickly sweet than Lifesavers or Jolly Ranchers. Good stuff.</td></tr><tr><td>Must say I'm quite sceptical of the 5* ratings I see... this CD has promise, but just comes off a little hollow musically and lyrically speaking.You may like it (I doubt it), but at the very least I'd say try before you buy. I think you'll be happy you did not spend the money up-front is all I'm saying. ;)</td></tr><tr><td>Very sturdy well made cables.  Their strain relief and shielding make them a little less flexible than less sturdy cables, but the included right angle adapter allows even tighter bend radius for installing in tight spaces.  The box also includes velcro like cable ties, a display cloth and LED keychain light.  I'm very happy with the cables, and would definitely buy these again</td></tr><tr><td>I like this medicine ball and I always appreciate everlast product.This ball is durable, heavy soft, and nice all together.I did not give it five stars because it made from robber and not from leather.This type of robber smells bad and stink my car.</td></tr><tr><td>I received a sample of this, and am surprised to see other reviewers saying that this isn't greasy. It's not *oily* or waxy the way something like cocoa butter or Eucerin would be, but it definitely leaves filmy fingerprints on everything for a while after you use it. It does smell more like lemongrass than lemon, and after the film works its way off, it's really a very nice moisturizer and softener. It's just not something I'd use while I'm on the computer since it leaves shiny prints behind on my keyboard.</td></tr><tr><td>Jackson Browne is one of the most introspective and reflective songwriters in music.  On his 1974 breakthrough album, Late For The Sky, he questions mortality and what lies beyond this life.  The titles of the songs are allusions to death or dying, the title track, &quot;Fountain Of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Farther On&quot;, &quot;The Road &amp; The Sky&quot;, &quot;Before The Deluge&quot;.  The subject matter sounds like it would make for an uncomfortable listen, but Mr. Browne is so sincere and pours his emotions into the music, that you swept up by it's plaintiveness.</td></tr><tr><td>This mirror is TRULY FOG FREE and inexpensive unlike other \"fog free\" mirrors.  Finally, a mirror that does what it says it will do!  It's very simple, hold it under the shower for 2-4 seconds before you shave and \"voila\" it does not fog up!  The mirror is very lightweight, a bit smaller than I was expecting, but the measurements are clearly depicted in the product description 4\" x 6\", like a photo.  I am a HUGE fan of the small plastic hook that sticks to the wall versus the suction cups.  No more falling off the wall in the middle of the night!!  I highly recommend this shaving mirror.</td></tr><tr><td>This pool rake is OK for skimming leafs and debris from the surface. But, the frame is too flimsy to clean leafs and debris from the pool bottom. With past rakes I have owned, I can apply some light pressure to the pole and push the rake forward along the pool bottom to collect leafs and debris. When I tried a similar technique with this rake the frame simply squishes together and gets out of shape making debris collection a real challenge. One more thing I did not like is the netting, which is very light weight. Several times the bag would float and turn inside-out during normal maneuvers causing the debris to escape back into the pool.</td></tr><tr><td>We wanted to melt these for some candy we were making.  However, they did not melt.  Instead they looked like some kind of sandy curd.  Totally unusable, no matter what we did.  So if you are using them in a recipe that requires melting....don't use them!  When we have previously used them to make the candy, there was no problem.  Same thing happened with the Nestle's Chocolate chips.  Just a warning..... Get another brand.</td></tr><tr><td>Keep these around and you are going to get a compulsion to clean and clean some more, just to see how much you can load into a bag.  They are really super strong.  I have not had any issues with the bags ripping or the strings falling off and I have loaded them to the brim with some heavy garbage.  Plus they roll out of the box very easily, you are not left accidentally grabbing like 5 bags at a time as with the lesser garbage bags.  Solid product.</td></tr><tr><td>If you like things natural and good for you, then I think you will like this. Doesn't really have a flaver to it so blends well with yogart or blender mixes. I've only used about half the recommended amount and been happy with it. At 50, I try to get a fair amount of fiber in my diet.I think this helped. The price is good too.</td></tr><tr><td>Bought this helmet in blue for a co-worker's birthday.  She LOVES Red Bull, so we made it look like a Red Bull can.  The blue is somewhere between navy and royal (fairly dark).  It was the perfect, inexpensive guzzling helmet, and she got loads of laughs!</td></tr><tr><td>My son love them he is the show at all the events we have he meets new friends who don't like music.</td></tr><tr><td>I like it a lot. Nautica Blue has a light, refreshing, non-overpowering smell to it. The only thing that sucks is that it wears off fast, but it's an EDT so what do you expect?</td></tr><tr><td>The item looks good and would seem to be good for attracting Humming Birds, it how ever it is not as good as it looks.I use four (4) feeders for Hummingbirds and the birds like them all, but not this one.The vertical feeders are much more in favor with the Humming Birds, at least in Arizona.I have had this up for about a month and it is getting no use at all, we however are feeding about 10 different Humming Birds.  This could be the answer in other areas.</td></tr><tr><td>It was really difficult to apply, and didn't come with any instructions. I ended up just throwing it away because it didn't work. I wouldn't recommend this if you don't already know how to apply a screen protector like this one.</td></tr><tr><td>He would not go to sleep without his Wubby! He always held on to the little animal like he was hugging it. Both my sons did this when they were little.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this for my teenager who keeps losing flash drives at school. This is a very unique one. Looks exactly like a thumb</td></tr><tr><td>I've used Flora Flor Essence Detox tea for quite some time now and love it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because I prefer the liquid. I don't really like to brew my own tea this way, however, it's more affordable and still has awesome health benefits. Highly recommend and I think this is a very high quality and trustworthy brand. I should also note that the liquid is worth the money I'm just on a budget. Either way Flor Essence Detox Tea is worth every penny. I've tried other generic versions of this and they do not compare in effectiveness.</td></tr><tr><td>I do like this case, It is a little thin which is fine but after awhile the raindrops start to come off (which I kind of expected, but not so soon) I love the colors!</td></tr><tr><td>I really like undergravel filters for filtration.  It's old school tech and if you go with some plants, it will fertilize them.  I've had systems setup where I didn't have to change water for 6 months because of the balance between plants and the filter.  Just topping off.  Just beware of some of the colored gravel.  I bought some from petco that broke down in 2 months and mass killed all the fish in my tank.  I've got the filter in another tank with different gravel and it's working fine.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great pillow, and it was delivered from a first class Amazon seller. I've been using this pillow every night for a few weeks now, and I like it a lot.  It is soft and comfortable and it is not too hot even on warm nights.</td></tr><tr><td>This is the tape to get. I didn't buy it for this purpose, but I now use a single piece on each hand to keep from tearing callouses off while working out. It is incredible that it stays on while I'm doing pull-ups. It is by far the best athletic tape I've ever used. It has very little stretch but it sticks like nothing else.</td></tr><tr><td>I use SebaMed exclusively now, as both face and body wash.  It's great for sensitive skin.  I like everything about it except the fragrance - smells a bit like hand soap in hospitals or doctors' offices.  Would be 5 stars if it were unscented.</td></tr><tr><td>The item shipped in about 5 -6 days (about normal) and arrives in a thin cardboard box (nothing else). Nothing unusually good or bad about the product or the service, though I will add a warning to any Rode Classic (1) owners that this shockmount is definitely not suitable for that original model Classic - despite what Rode themselves might say. I was advised by Rode that I could modify the mount by cutting a hole in the bottom (this thing is just made of thick plastic) to pass the cable through, but that in no way makes it useful anyway as the mic is not held in place in the mount. Compared to the mounts from even self-professed low-end companies like MXL, this shock mount is pretty cheap and flimsy looking - of course it may work beautifully with the newer Rode mics for which it was intended ...</td></tr><tr><td>Not thrilled at all. It's way smaller than I anticipated, which is my fault for not paying attention to the dimensions. At first I thought I got the junior model.  I also don't think the material is very comfortable. And it collects pet hair like a magnet. I needed something that i could use to prop me up on my couch so i could see the TV better. It does the job. But i found it to be uncomfortable. So now it sits in the corner collecting dust. I was attracted to this item based on all the great reviews. I'm not sure what everyone likes about it. It is what it is and I received exactly what was advertised. But I have seen better ones in stores. I suggest looking around. I rated it 3 stars because compared to others I've seen, this item is just OK.</td></tr><tr><td>The package from Amazon arrived right on time, and because I'm allergic to sizing, I washed the sheets before using them...they are thin, yes, but they felt like slipping into heaven when I climbed into bed!  so extremely soft.  I have washed them no less than 4 times already and they have really held up well.  I read some comments saying the hems were coming out, etc...not on mine!  I love them and that's all I can say!</td></tr><tr><td>This stuff is a great value.  I have very oily hair and have struggled to find a shampoo that gets rid of all the oil with each wash.  This stuff does!  Makes my hair so clean, light, and fresh!  The scent is very nice, too.  I also really like the matching conditioner.  Can't beat the price!</td></tr><tr><td>This is exactly what I expected.  The item looks exactly like it is depicted and works perfectly for my use.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great stand, sturdy, well made and versatile.  I use it for a heavy electric assist aluminum bike and it holds the bike very steady at a wide variety of heights.  If you are going to get a stand and especially if you have a heavy bike, this is the best home stand I was able to find and can not say enough how much I like it.  By the way, Park is a first class company.  When I received the stand, it was scratched in shipping and they sent me replacement parts to make it right with no hassle or problems.  five star all the way.</td></tr><tr><td>I was really weary about buying a cough online, but glad I did. Looks beautiful and feels great under my bum! Not too hard, not too soft. The fabric feels really nice, too. I'm really glad I took the jump.Set up was pretty easy, but it's probably better to do it with 2 ppl, so one person can hold the compartment while the other screws it in.Just really wish the ottoman would open like a chest, so I can put things in it.</td></tr><tr><td>I have been playing guitar for 4 years and this guitar is amazing.I don't see why it gets complaints, its a great guitar and i haven't had any problems with it. The last important thing is the tone, it doesn't sound at all like a starter guitar. I'm surprised a guitar this cheap in price could be this good.</td></tr><tr><td>MY WIFE HAD LOOKED ALL OVER TOWN FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND HAD NO LUCK. ONLY TOOK FIVE MINUTES ON AMAZON AND SHE HAD EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED. THE SET WAS PACKAGED VERY WELL, WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE LOOKING THIS TYPE OF CANNISTER SET.</td></tr><tr><td>The movie appeared in good condition.  Another movie I like better in full screen format which I was glad was able to find.  It was a speedy shipment.</td></tr><tr><td>I would never imagine that a kind of watch like this would support a phonedirectory and so many different time zones. It is very user friendly, light,cool... It delivers what is promised.I was wondering how to set the analog watch because I didnt see the smallclock and, but actually it is very easy. It's just 2 buttoms away.It looks better than in the picture.I love it!!!</td></tr><tr><td>It's very comfortable.  I switch positions a lot, so it wasn't hard to turn it around with me.  The pieces are detachable, so you don't need to use the whole length of pillow.  Sometimes I just use the pillow for in between my legs.  I'm a plus size girl, and the size is good.The down side: I don't think it's made with enough fill in.  It's fluffy, but I'm not sure how long it will last without me having to refill it.  I wish it had a cover or case.  I like to wash things before using it, but I didn't with the fear of loosing the fluffiness.  I don't think it's worth over $50.00, but I'm still happy with it.</td></tr><tr><td>So far so good... looks like a real good quality product but we haven't had snow yet to try it out!</td></tr><tr><td>The only problem with this food is that now my cats don't like to eat much of anything else!  I've had my two cats on it for over 3 years now (with only occasional deviations to try new food) and both cats are in wonderful health.  Even the vet fawns over their sleek and soft coats.</td></tr><tr><td>We have had three of these wireless doorbells over the past three years. They work, but because we live in Florida and our aluminum door (trailer)is exposed to a lot of sun, the adhesive does not stick on the sending unit (the button part)and the the batteries have to be replaced very frequently. However, all that aside, we still like it. We purchased a roll of \"more\" durable sticky tape and several back up batteries.  We have even purchased a backup unit!</td></tr><tr><td>This product made my skin very dry and made me look white like a ghost, it made my skin breakout in less than 72 hours and i immediately stopped using it. I don't know if this product is for women of all color because it really looks bad on my skin. It is horrible! waste of money.</td></tr><tr><td>My family's first reaction to this new flatware was that is weightier than any we'd used previously.  Sounds silly but when first picking it up this makes an impression. Seems very solid.  The spoons feel like we'd be able to scoop hard ice cream without any concern of bending, though I confess we didn't actually try that experiment!The handles don't curve at all, so they aren't terribly comfortable in your hand, but the nature of this product doesn't require that.  I wouldn't want to write an essay with them, but then they aren't pens!My biggest disappointment with them is that the manufacturer has stamped a small square logo into the bowl of the spoon and fork and at first glance I thought they were dirty. To see what I mean, zoom in on the product photo. The logo is so small, it is totally ineffective for brand recognition so I'm not sure the designer was going for here.  There's a largish and more effective logo and brand name embossed on the back of the handles.</td></tr><tr><td>It looks great and lights up like the sun. Well built and looks fanstastic. However, if you have a wrangler from 03-06 (there isn't an ashtray next to the auxiliary outlets) it wont fit because it sits too far back into the dash and there is a little overhang that prevents it from fitting there. I ended up trying to trim it down, which required me to cut the top of the switch all the way down to where the light should be shining through for it to fit. It works but looks messy. So I'm ordering a new one and cutting out a place for it on the blank panel next to the switches</td></tr><tr><td>My DVD's came in far sooner than they were projected to. Brand new condition, too. The new lower price should make it easier for fans to see where their favorite new SF show came from.There's nothing like the real thing and this is it!</td></tr><tr><td>Product finally arrived in the mail after waiting for it for a very long time. It was packaged well, but covered in toner, I had to vacuum it off. Printer will not recognize cartridge. It came with a CD labeled \"driver patch for ML-1910\" - I'm not really in the mood to have to hax0r my work computer to get a black market toner cartridge to operate correctly (or at all). A little transparency would have been nice when purchasing this product. I would expect a dealing like this from ebay, not Amazon. Reading the other reviews, I'm not sure if I should bother sending it back, it sounds like people have not had good luck getting refunded. I should have read the reviews first...but it's a toner cartridge, I thought it would be simple enough to get that right.</td></tr><tr><td>I like it but I don't think I've used it long enough to see much difference. Why do I have to say more?</td></tr><tr><td>Good case. It wa shown like in the pictures. A little tacky but not bad really like it in my phone.</td></tr><tr><td>I'd been wanting a design like this in my bathroom for quite some time, and after searching around online, I found this curtain. It's fabric, so you will need a plastic liner, but I had one anyway. The only issue I've noticed - and I don't think it's the curtain itself - is that the weight of the curtain + liner is sometimes enough to pull apart my curtain rings (purchased at the chain of stores that begins with T and has a red logo, similar to these: http://www.amazon.com/Polished-Chrome-Rolling-Shower-Curtain/dp/B00AA0H0XA), but I suspect that's a defect in the ring, not the curtain. :)</td></tr><tr><td>Im a utility worker and was aporoached by a large dog and used  dog repeller and it didnt seem to bother him and he continued to bark like crazy</td></tr><tr><td>I like having the subscription, it saves a few bucks and I always have coffee on hand.  The send more now option is perfect for the times you might run short</td></tr><tr><td>Just a head's up to those interested out there...this paddle is compatible with the 4.5 qt K4SS model of the mixer. It is just like the original that came with the mixer and works phenomenally. I got this for my wife so she would have an extra so she didnt have to wash hers over and over again. If you are looking for attachments for the K4 (which are hard to find) this fits perfectly!</td></tr><tr><td>This is a cute set but requires an older kid or parent to assemble.  Not easy for a 6 year old to make the headbands.  They are cute and I think the price was fair.  I think my 9 year old grand daughter would like to have a set.</td></tr><tr><td>I like this product and because of that order 2 bottle this fish oil. I hope so it would be best for me</td></tr><tr><td>I like it.  It looked like it appeared but I expected somethinjg a little more upscale looking.  Not the Seller's fault.  It was my expectations.  I do like and I get compliments.</td></tr><tr><td>My kids like these, but I think they are pretty watery.  They are better when choosing a serving size with less water (the smallest option on my Keurig is best), but still, just ok.  I probably won't buy them again.</td></tr><tr><td>I got this product home at 7:30p in the evening and by 8 we had it assembled and my daughter and I were riding down the road...she loves it! I wish they had one for children over 40lbs! I have taken it camping and can't find a single thing I dont like yet.!</td></tr><tr><td>We've used this sauce for years and when the local supermarket stopped carrying it I was glad to find it on Amazon. If you like Szechuan this is the sauce for you.</td></tr><tr><td>The steam on wrinkles of fabric works very good like clothings.Demerits : The steam pipe is hot and doesnt have insulation which may burn you if touch your skinThe brush part is not strong so bends after 1-2 uses.Could have steam regulator so that you regulate the steam as per usage.</td></tr><tr><td>The figure is ok, but I hate it. First the lightsaber can't fit in the hand , only the robot hand. Second the right hand can pop out to put the robot hand In , guess what it is loose so if a kid goes to play with it , will you guest it ...last the has ok detail not the best I have seen but ok. Overall the figure didn't suck but I didn't even like it.</td></tr><tr><td>Its adorable, and it works like a charm!!!  It really does its job very well and is a fun friend.</td></tr><tr><td>When I started drinking Sparkling Ice, I was really excited, I told all my friends about this new found jewel. Well my excitement was short lived. This drink, sparkles all over the place...uhhh. What i'm saying is that it is so carbonated that you have to make sure you open the same bottle with caution everytime you want to drink it, otherwise it will explode all over your clothes, books etc, which I experienced. I was so mad I thought I may like the taste but lm not going to be on the edge each time I want to open a bottle I have already been drinking from. Its like you cannot afford to be distracted if you want to drink Sparkling Ice that's for sure....</td></tr><tr><td>I was concerned these pretzels might not taste like the brands the kids were used to.  However,  they love the taste of these pretzels and want more.</td></tr><tr><td>As a co-leader for a group, I often have to interact with other members while practicing or performing and having a guitar on my lap precludes my stepping away from the microphone.  Now, I no longer have to worry about the congregation or audience overhearing my directions and comments. I really like the red ring which turns to set it on or off switch rather than a toggle switch.  It turns real softly and you can kind of feel it \"click\" into position so you can switch it on and off very discretely. The only thing that would improve this product would be a more clear indication of the on and off positions. While the positions are in fact marked, it is etched into the metal and not so easily readable when directly in front of the mic.  But this is a really minor thing so I still chose to give it five stars.</td></tr><tr><td>Yes - I got suckered too.  The only reason I gave this a one-star rating was that you can't give a zero.  The only metal you'll find with this wall bracket are the screws to hold it on, and if you tighten them a bit much, you'll probably crack this PLASTIC WALL BRACKET.  I wish Amazon would start monitoring its suppliers, like eBay, so customers don't continue to be had by misleading suppliers.  What a waste of money - could have used that towards a REAL wall bracket.</td></tr><tr><td>This product is ridiculously complex.  The interface will require referring to the manual again and again.  Very little is intuitive.  Simple things like activating the light require multiple button presses, on two buttons, neither is labeled \"light\".It's not Mac compatible and says nothing about this on the package.  The wireless \"ANT\" stick requires a PC.  There is Mac software for the Garmin Training center, but no way for the 405 to connect to it.On a PC the ANT software runs constantly, that is rather than just running when the Garmin Training center application is running, it runs 24/7 slowing your computer.  Data is transfered to it (slowly) then to the Training Center.</td></tr><tr><td>I don't really like this stuff at all, It makes my skin look dry and doesn't really make my face look any better. It does make my face smother to the touch where it doesn't just look dry and gross though. Overall I just think I will stick with not using finishing powder.</td></tr><tr><td>This bed came shrink-wrapped and sealed, not loose.  I really appreciated that.  The manufacturer obviously cares about the quality of its beds.  The material is incredibly comfortable, soft, and inviting.  The colors are accurate, as pictured.  Very attractive.  I also like that the upturned sides STAY upright and do not flop like cheaper beds.  In my opinion, animals appreciate those upturned sides as they provide an added sense of security.  So, this bed does the trick.  It holds its form, looks attractive, and feels genuinely comfortable.  The pillow in the middle is thick, so an animal of any weight really can enjoy it.Great bed.  Buy it.  No complaints.  I will buy more from this company.  Definitely.</td></tr><tr><td>Lenses are scratches, the inside of the mask smell like chemicals, the mask inside is dirty, the tube where you drink inside the mask is either white paint or bird s***, IT DOESN'T EVEN come with the HYRDRATION TUBE (WTF!) the chin part of the mask is musty dust that i can't even clean off. Overall I'm not satisfied</td></tr><tr><td>This toy is perfect--cool enough that my son thinks it's great, but mellow enough not to make everyone in the vicinity hate us. You unscrew the cap and either dunk it in the pool or use a hose to fill it up (my 6-year-old figured this out independently before I looked at it, so it's easy), then each time you \"pump\" the bottom orange piece it shoots out 5 streams of water--which are more like a shower, or a hose with a nozzle set on \"spray\" rather than something that will DOUSE you. It shoots about 20 feet (mayyyybe 25 if you angle it just right), so it's fun and you get quite wet, but the water doesn't push hard (like some guns where you have to turn your head to avoid eye damage). Bonus: even when it's full it will still float in a pool, so you don't have to worry about hunting for it at the bottom of the pool if someone drops it.</td></tr><tr><td>So this is a bright red bird feeder. Fill it with nectar, hang it up and let them go to town.Well, I've hung it up, filled it with nectar and...the birds aren't exactly flocking. I've seen two hummingbirds come have a drink in the last couple days, but all they do is sip for about three seconds and fly off. I'm not sure if that is typical or not, butt here you go.So, yeah. It's not the most attractive thing in the world, but I guess the birds like it. It is what it is.</td></tr><tr><td>The gun fits in the holster perfectly.  The holster is sturdy and well-made.  When accessing my Ruger LCP from the holster, the flap of the holster naturally flay outward, thereby catching on the inside of my pocket and keeping the holster in my pocket.  So the gun comes out easily and the holster stays in place -- excellent!  The bad part is, that the holster needs to be another 1/2 inch or so wider.  The way it is now, the bottom 1/2 inch or so of the gun handle/clip is not covered by the holster.  Therefore you can sort of figure out it's a gun by the imprint, instead of just looking like a wallet or some other nondescript square item in my pocket.  This drawback is the only reason I will not give this 5 stars, but this is a big issue for me.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like how this pillow does not take in water so you can move it without getting everything soaked. It is also squishy and gives good back support. Only reason for not giving it five stars is because fits better in large tubs than in small ones. And it sometimes comes unsticked but, hey that's every bath pillow for you. But it works how it should and it was very reasonably priced.</td></tr><tr><td>I had the same one last year and I like how it's organized and how compact it is. Only problem is it starts to get a bit tattered around September...</td></tr><tr><td>This rice side dish was easy to prepare and very tasty. Wasn't that spicy, but for my mom who doesn't like anything that spicy it was perfect- I added some hot sauce and it was perfect. From start to finish only took around 10 min ( about 8 min to boil ) very easy to cook and a good side dish that is different.</td></tr><tr><td>it's nice to have choices and doubly nice with good prices. Like having a supermarket full of exotic foods inside your computer.</td></tr><tr><td>I like everything about this toaster except for the length of the bread slots.  They are 5 inches long, and if you use \"rectangular\" bread (Rudi's, EarthGrains, etc), rather than \"square\" bread, you have to slightly bend it to get it in the slot, which causes it to toast unevenly.  The other option is to turn the slice 90 degrees, but then the end sticks out of the top and doesn't get toasted.</td></tr><tr><td>This reflective is SO bright. I was a bit skeptical when I pulled it out of the box, but then I put it in front of a headlight. WOW! It is not actually tape; it needs to be sewn on. It is strips of reflective material. I've hand sewn it, used a sewing machine on it and used material glue. All of the gear that I have used this on has held up just fine. It is not a deep black, it is subtly lighter than that, but that is because of the reflective properties. I've sewn it onto riding jackets and bags, both black. While you can see the strip, it basically looks like it's supposed to be there. And, it is a very non-invasive way (the complete opposite of a high viz vest, but just as noticeable) to add a huge margin of safety when riding at night. When I run out, I will definitely buy more (there is a TON of this stuff in the package!). I couldn't be happier with this stuff.</td></tr><tr><td>Pretty good quality, but when I opened the box, it smelled like china sweat shop. But assembly took about 25 minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>Soap smells great and doesn't seem to dry out the skin like other soaps do.  A little bit more liquidy than other soaps but just takes a little getting used to.</td></tr><tr><td>So ditto to the title line... I have the Panasonic 3 handset system and just needed one more handset for the living room. It was basically plug and play and charge for overnight. I like when thing work this way! All electronics stuff does not necessarily work that easily.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this pillow because my chiropractor recommended it. I'm not a fan of the pillow cause I'm more of a side sleeper. I know they say you can use it being a side sleeper but I felt like there was no room for my head. Not very comfy. My cats on the other hand.....LOVE this pillow. It is sitting on my couch with a pillow case on it..they love sleeping on it with the little hole or dip in the middle and fight over it constantly. I debated buying a second one...for them...not me.</td></tr><tr><td>While I like the harder, edgier World of Noise better myself, this album is the best they've released since.  I found Sparkle and Fade disappointing (the songs were good, but I found it tedious), and Songs...pt. 1 is too pop for me.  Songs...pt. 2 is very good, but this is better.  In addition to featuring the hits &quot;I Will Buy You A New Life,&quot; &quot;Father Of Mine&quot; and &quot;Normal Like You,&quot; this has some of Everclear's best songs on it, from &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot; to the second best Everclear song, &quot;Sunflowers&quot; to the hidden track &quot;Christmas Card&quot; (or &quot;I'll Be Hating You At Christmas&quot; depending on who you ask) to &quot;Why I Don't Believe in God&quot; (which makes me cry when I listen to it).  Art's lyrics are incredible, his eloquently simple guitar is nicely complemented by Craig's bass guitar and Greg's frenzied drumming.  I would highly reccomend this album.  After this, I'd pick up Songs...pt 2, and if you like that, get World of Noise.</td></tr><tr><td>The print is adorable and the fabric really looked like it would last.  Unfortunately I needed it to be large enough to fit my son's lunch box.  The measurements listed are misleading.  The width is not at the bottom of the backpack but at the top.  The base of the bag is not 12x7 but more like 10x5.  Son was disappointed that we couldn't keep it but it was not at all the correct size.</td></tr><tr><td>This product works (hence the 3 stars) - it just doesn't work that well.  I like my coffee finely ground (I drink Espresso).  The best I can do is get it medium ground.  The measurement lines are a bit excessive.  When I make beans for 12 cups - the coffee is way too strong even for me.  I have to grind beans at the 10 cup capacity to get great strong coffee for 12 cups.  The measuring cup is too deep - hence the grinding problem.  I had a Black and Decker grinder (that was much cheaper) that worked better than this - unfortunately it burnt out.</td></tr><tr><td>I think the design is both ugly, and inefficient. It looks like a bum, and the single-length zipper limits pocket space. Even if there was 2 zippers and you could fill the pockets up it would still look like a bum.</td></tr><tr><td>What can you say about connect 4? It is a classic. I wish it were a option game that more than 2 can play. We have 3 in our family and one might get left out. She doesnt like that.</td></tr><tr><td>I have insomnia and have always taken something to help me get to sleep.  This works just as well as any Doctor prescribed medicine I have ever taken.  I don't feel like I'm dragging in the morning and can not think of one negative thing to say about Unisom.  A lot of the other over the counter sleeping aids contain acetaminophen which I cannot take for medical reasons.</td></tr><tr><td>I read Stephen King's \"Carrie\" at a young age, when I was 13, and not surprisingly, it freaked me out. Now I saw the movie for the first time at 32. Brian De Palma's credit lies in being able to make the film as breathtakingly engrossing as I felt when i was reading the book. Tastes develop, and something i liked at 13 is not likely to impress much in my early 30s, but with \"Carrie\" the movie I felt like i was revisiting the book, and felt all the chills again. But the film, or the book for that matter, is not just about chill factor. Issues like teenage angst, upbringing, peer pressure and the need to fit in are touched upon in the process, without losing sight of the fact that this is a \"horror movie\". We are left thinking does Carrie White really deserve to burn in hell, as the graffiti on the vacant plot notice says? In my book she doesn't. Contrast the families of Carrie and Sue Snell. Carrie's mother is a fundamentalist freak who calls breasts 'dirty pillows' and thinks the natural processes of growing up are sinfull. No wonder then that her daughter is a social misfit. Sue Snell's family, by contrast, is happy American suburbia. Although Sue initially takes part in tormenting Carrie, she quickly makes amends and is redeemed. In the end, she is the only survivor in the horrible climax, which is somewhat cheesily done (by today's standards) in split screen (i am told that was a common technique in 70s movies). But memorable scenes abound, the opening shower sequence, the silenced bloodbath scene with just the sound of blood dripping from the bucket, Carrie's mother knifed to the walls in a crucifix form, but my favourite came pretty early in the movie, the scene in the classroom when Carrie says she finds Tommie Ross' poem \"beautiful\" - an over-the-shoulder cam shot in which both characters are facing us, we can see the expressions of Tommie and Carrie, he really likes her. Perhaps he didnt deserve to die. Fantastic performance by Sissy Spacek!</td></tr><tr><td>An attempt at an update via Jawbones site turned this headset into a brick. This was a birthday purchase and I was furious when the device was rendered useless before even being tried out. The retail packaging is also false . This item is not packaged exactly like the retailer. This was a huge disappointment.</td></tr><tr><td>I got these to tidy up a center bolt stroker motor build and like anything custom built my application required some fitting due to my cylinder head and valve cover choice but the product did it's job and was affordable.</td></tr><tr><td>Very nice tablet, but I'm still an iPad 3 lover.  I love the size of the iPad.I bought it for the hubby and he is learning how to use a tablet.  Very nice resolution and fast internet.  Having the front and rear cameras is great (like iPad 3).  My son wants to trade me.  He has the Nexus 7, first one didn't have 2 cameras.</td></tr><tr><td>The ideea of the game is really cool. The quality of the materials used is quite poor, it's just a cheap plastic and also the colored circles you use for playing are also cheap plastic.The rotation of each square, especially the middle square is difficult, for sure the implementation of this really cool game could have been much better.The simple pentago (the wood version) is much better constructed.So if youre a big fan of pentago and you don't care about the quality of the plastic then buy it, but for more than 30$ they could have made it much better.</td></tr><tr><td>Purchased this as my computer keyboards key letters were wearing off. Read the prior reviews, and decided to go for it. Very pleased with service from Amazon, received the next day, and tried it out. It is solid, easy to get used to, and nice feeling when you hit a key stroke. For my 12.00 , it was money well spent. Would eventually like to go for the illuminated keyboard, but for now, cannot complain.</td></tr><tr><td>This replaced my 40 year old plastic scoop that came with the original Norelco drip coffee maker.  We always grind our own beans, so this is not used for ground coffee.  I like the no-stain cleanliness of the stainless steel.  I think it is of heavy duty construction, in fact it weighs more than you would expect.  My only reservation is that the top opening is much larger than the somewhat rectangular top of my old scoop and leveling the beans is slightly more difficult.</td></tr><tr><td>I found this album a few years ago in my local library and listened to it several times.  I've been keeping my eye out for it ever since.  Hickman likes to have fun with her music.  And while her lyrics often deal with  love and relationship, she tends to shift the focus in ways that are both  imaginitive and refreshing.  Her imagery unusual and poignant -- quirky in  a way that is all her own.  Most memorable are the songs &quot;Too  Fast&quot; and &quot;Claim on My Heart.&quot;  The first is about an  after-work rendezvous between playful couple in love (or is it merely  lust).  The second is a first-person narrative by a woman that would like  to give her lover everything, but hopes that he will settle &quot;for a  claim on her heart.&quot;  It's a song that risks being sappy, but instead  comes across as being sincere.</td></tr><tr><td>I decided to switch from Verizon to Straight Talk but didn't want a Straight Talk phone. After reading the reviews, I bought this one and the Straight Talk sim card. I am very, very pleased. It's easier to use than my old iphone or my old droid. It is also very light weight. If you're someone who drops things (like myself) I recommend purchasing the warranty and a case. Also--it does work with the Bluetooth in the 2014 Nissan Rogue. Enjoy!</td></tr><tr><td>I have an older series of this, not the wet/dry version. Used this shaver 2 times thus far and like the shave. I have a very sensitive face and can't shave every day. I also need to dry shave with a regular razor after the electric. Although this currently gets a nice close shave, I still need to complete by using reg razor. My face is still getting accustomed to this shaver but so far I like the purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>Seems like a quality cable but one of the ends was bent upon arrival making it impossible to plug into a device.</td></tr><tr><td>Thanks to LUSTER Premium Whitening and Influenster I received a complimentary product for testing and review purposes and oh MY did I absolutely LOVE it! I personally think that it's a little thicker then the toothpaste I was previously using but it makes my entire mouth feel fresh and clean and after just a few days I started to notice a difference in my teeth becoming whiter. How awesome is that?! It also had a great minty taste (because I can NOT stand weird flavored toothpaste... it doesn't make me feel like my teeth have been cleaned) but that wasn't the case with the luster toothpaste. I loved my sample and will definitely be purchasing more! I would recommend to EVERYONE to try it out because not only is it inexpensive, it works wonders also!</td></tr><tr><td>This is the perfect bandanna if you want to look like Willy on Duck Dynasty. It worked perfectly for my Halloween costume.</td></tr><tr><td>I'm one who not only appreciates function, I like what I have to look good, and this little hard drive fits the bill. My 'geekie' grandson thought I made a good choice. Beautiful.</td></tr><tr><td>Its not real bulky - which I did not want.  It actually keeps the phone safe - I absolutely love it.  I've had it for a while and my phone is still like new.  I would recommend this to everyone.</td></tr><tr><td>I work in the field a lot and use a lot of the Purple Nitrile Exam Gloves. I hate that I dispose so many exam gloves and the exam gloves don't protect against punctures. That's why I bought these gloves. It's reusable, I haven't gotten punctured...yet... One thing I don't like is that it's kind of difficult to use the gloves to hold a pen to write something, unlike the exam gloves which are thinner. But that's a minor problem and taking the gloves off solves that problem. I also like the velcro. Overall, I would recommend this product.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like the cute design and it fits my phone perfectly, but it won't fit in a base charger. My car charger (on a cord) fits fine though.</td></tr><tr><td>My ESL kids like this game.  However, we can hardly ever win all the cards when you have to put your ear to one item.  Maybe they should change that  to a different body part.  It is a good twist on Twister and the kids can practice their alphabet and vocabulary.</td></tr><tr><td>I've had this product for a while now. It is easy to clean and still looks good. I don't have to worry about paint peeling off this product like some wood seats. It is sturdy enough to stand on as to reach for something. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants an easy-to-clean (can use diluted bleach), won't-peel, toilet seat.</td></tr><tr><td>they do a great job... I really like the vacuum too--- it works well and we have a German Shepherd Dog so we need a good vacuum for dog hair</td></tr><tr><td>I've used this saw three times since receiving it.  I'm amazed at how powerful it is even at a distance of around 200 feet from the power source.  It is lightweight, easy to hold and operate.  The automatic chain oil uses a bit but then that's a good thing.  I was also surprised at how easy it cuts through fairly large limbs.  After use, I clean it with an old paint brush and put the bar cover on, which keeps any remaining oil on the chain from dripping on the floor or bench where you store it.  I really like this saw and highly recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>The locking mechanism works well. The strap is very long, the way I like as I wear my guitars low. I do wish it had a pick pocket on it. That comes in handy.</td></tr><tr><td>Fit like a glove.  Was exactly what we wanted. Was so easy to order through Amazon. Absolutlly a quality product.</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book recently while traveling - like most Stephen King novels, the book holds the reader's attention - with sufficient descriptions, narratives and character development.  Unfortunately, this adaptation significantly deviates from the story's plot, is not a true representation of how the tale is told in King's novel.  In fact, there are several scenes that are not representative of anything in the novel and the distortion of a solid sci fi/horror story is very disappointing. If you've read the book I'm sure that you'll find yourself numerous times wanting to turn off the movie and retain your fond memories of a good read.</td></tr><tr><td>My 4 year old dog's breath was really foul like a sewer. I bought this and only suirt a very small amount in a bowl of water and within a day or 2 my dog's breath is now pleasant, smells nothing like it did. I cannot believe the difference and will be using this all the time now. I never write reviews but had to in this case as this product is really impressive and certainly exceeded my expectations...</td></tr><tr><td>I'm a cyclist, I ride daily, get my share of flats, but I can most always rely on these generic Co2 cartridges to do their job. When you buy in this quantity they end up costing less than a dollar each. Downside, I had one dud in a previous pack of 30 and I've had a couple that barely filled a road tire and probably wouldn't fill a mtbike tire. Carry extras. I like savings, especially on something that doesn't actually improve my performance.</td></tr><tr><td>I like this product a lot & shop for the best price.  Amazon.com is cheaper than Target & Walgreens but ebay still has the best price if you can find what you're looking to buy.</td></tr><tr><td>I received a free trial of this and my nieces both liked it. However, my son was still a bit iffy about it. It may have been because he doesn't like powerful flavors, but as I stated my nieces didn't complain at all about it and my son did think it tasted better than his original medicine.</td></tr><tr><td>As advertised! Wouldn't guess it's a file cabinet looking at it. I does have sharp corners, but it was not hard to put the handles on like some said!</td></tr><tr><td>The wooden tracked matched up with the exisiting ones just like it should! The track works just like the original</td></tr><tr><td>Having worked for high-level executives in corporate and military careers as a young man, I can vouch for the authenticity of what's taught in The Devil Wears Prada.  Meryl Streep's portrayal of a person with immense responsibility is right on target.  That is, the moral of the story can take on different dimensions.  As a young person, the school of hard knocks often makes clear the path towards the future.  It's like a prism - only you can decide which side to see it from.</td></tr><tr><td>Here's the problem---it is useless.  The only (useless) restraint possibility is a lead attached ONLY to the cushion.  No dog in a car should be unrestrained.  I would like my money refunded.  Price is outrageous.  No clue to uselessness until a lot of time spent installing it.</td></tr><tr><td>The coffee is delicious, the carafe keeps coffee very hot for 1 hour (without prior warming the carafe and 2 hours with prior warming). It tastes like regular coffee after 2 hours. The brewer and the pot wash easily. I live in Arizona where lightning frequently interprets the electricity, so far no problem with the pot (after 2 months of our monsoon and lightning storms). I have the pot on a serge protector. I highly recommend Bunn BTX-S with the Thermal Carafe. I am glad my Braun died after 5 years because I found Bunn.</td></tr><tr><td>Seen this and i had to get my hands on it. Such a unique minifig. Lego deff needs to bring back creatures with big head sculpts like this.</td></tr><tr><td>We like the product. It is like shown. The general quality is better than Ikea but in the same price range.We are nevertheless not happy because we found while we assembled it, which is a little complicated by the way! several scratches and marks which are partially on prominent spots of the established product. So that they are visible forever. The scratches were partly painted by the manufacturer, but still very clear to see.I tried to communicate with the seller but got no answer. Since we build it up and the baby is due soon, we don't returned it.</td></tr><tr><td>Keith Urban has a beautiful voice, this is an amazing CD. I love to listen to the words of each of his songs. I wanted to try to share a favorite song but I love them all. &quot;Somebody Like You&quot;, &quot;Song for Dad&quot; and &quot;Raining on Sunday&quot; I guess would have to be my most favorite songs.Keith Urban is an amazing individual, and incredible artist!</td></tr><tr><td>I like the size of the heating pad. It does NOT have an automatic shut-off, which is fine with me because my old one would shut off when I didn't want it to.The thing I do not like about this pad is that it is very stiff, and the chord is also very stiff. The chord won't straighten out without pulling on it, and then when you let go it goes back to being all kinked up again. It is hard to handle. NOT recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>This gun performs flawlessly.It also has an ergonomic grip that fits nicely in hand.I compared it to a friends ingersoll rand 1/2 gun. His want about an inch shorter and performed about the same.The two guns are almost identical in weight however.The only thing I don't like about the gun is to switch from forward to reverse you turn the dial on the back instead of pushing a button.Overall this gun is definitely worth the buy.I would recommend this gun to anybody.</td></tr><tr><td>It's a good idea but it's basically useless if attached the klickfix basket in front of it. It's only good for like bike computer or gps. it's not high enough for bike light. But if you remove the basket then this won't be an issue. If you attach a basket in front, the basket will block the beam of the light.</td></tr><tr><td>I am ok with this product. They do have a slight plastic/rubber odor but this was not a problem for me. I am not that sensitive to chemical smells but if you are you will have issues with most after market mats. I found these to be thin and flexy enough to conform to the curves of you floor but thick in the heavy wear areas. The mats have lots of cutting lines to help you fit them to your vehicle. Most after market mats cheap out on the rears but these are great. They are just like the fronts with cut lines and fit my car almost perfect which is a plus with messy kids. Stay away from auto parts stores, they have over priced, cheap mats.Update 1/20/13: Went by Walmart and Costco this weekend and found much better floor mats for less money. They were much thicker with a raised outer edge to keep the water off the carpet. Over all I am ok with these but there are better ones out there, I just need to look more. I won't buy these again.</td></tr><tr><td>My uncle has a box like this, and I have often admired it. I am delighted to say goodbye to trips to the post office to pick up every little package because I have dogs.This mailbox is huge. Most packages that are too bit to fit in there would probably be delivered by UPS anyway. It comes with the hardware inside, though we had to buy some additional brackets to get it mounted.I highly recommend this for the modern online shopper :-)</td></tr><tr><td>This product is pretty good, it is easy to apply but I till need to use my fingers to apply as the stick (which is sorta like a deodorant stick) is too wide. It would be nicer it is was more like a pen.</td></tr><tr><td>If you like a soft scent that smells better on you the longer you wear it, you will like this one.</td></tr><tr><td>I would like to thank the seller and Amazon CS for providing me the best customer service.  The Amazon agent Daniel quickly assessed the problem when the device would not work.  Daniel provided the right solution and I was able to obtain the correct product to function with my cell.  This is a good device but not functional for cellular phones.  My issue was understood and promptly resolved.  Best customer service ever.  Amazon agents are brilliant, courteous and effective in resolving solutions to provide the best outcome, always.  Thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>No problems, it works just like any other power adapter.</td></tr><tr><td>I got the Sadwich Shop for my twin 2-year olds and they love it! They can make their sandwich any way they like and the veggies are very realistic looking. They think the burger pattie and steak are cookies! I would definitely recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>Like I said above:) its a calendar with many amazing pictures of my favorite ball park!  Go Sox Go Sox!</td></tr><tr><td>WEll i was wondering what the first ameican idol winner would do for her second album. I mean there are so many ways she could go. But to go rock? Who would have thought. I sure didnt. I am the last person you would see listening to rock or at a rock concert. But when i heard this album i am a new fan of the genre. Starting with Breakaway from a DISNEY movie your gonna think, oh my, but then you tune to #2 or turn on the radio and she is CHANGED! This is a prime example why she was the first winner of American Idol. She is strong on this record. But I think the real test will be to see what her third record will be like. If she switches it up and makes it, she then is a true artist. I would have to say spending the $ to buy this cd is well worth it. Every song is strong and to the point and you get to see and hear a little more about her personal life. GO GET THIS CD NOW!</td></tr><tr><td>There we go, Dave! Stickin' it to the man! I bet you didn't even care when you found out your new CD was going to be copy-protected. After all, you're probably one of those Bush-hating economic conservative hypocrites, you being so rich and all.My theory professor found some way to BURN (yes, illegally, cause I didn't wanna spend my cash on this crap) this CD for me (he's all about DMB for some reason) and told me I'd probably like it (I generally like fusion, jazz-rock, jazzcore, so on.)However, DMB is a pop band first and foremost; they're a hit-making machine led on a tight leash by some off-key drunkard named Dave St. Matthews or something like that.I can't wait for his band to kick him out and change their name to \"The Supremely Awesome Hercules-Riding-A-Motorcycle Jam Band\" and they'll do all sorts of cool stuff that makes us throw away our Phish records in shame of spending our time with lesser jam.</td></tr><tr><td>I have found this to be the best pedometer I have ever used. I especially like the fact I can just drop in in my pocket and it will give me an accurate count. Other pedometers clip on a belt or somewhere and get caught up on things when I am busy.I would highly recommend this Ozeri 4X3motion digital pocket pedometer.</td></tr><tr><td>I can tell the company is intent on high customer service and the scale measures just like a similiar more expensive brand. Very happy with my purchase!</td></tr><tr><td>While the Freaks and Geeks: The Complete Series was an expensive purchase, it was worth it. You often here this show listed in the best of the 00's and how it was canceled too soon. Does the show live up to the hype? I believe so.I watched the first episodes alone but my sister starting to join in and began to obsesses over it. Just from the beginning of watching this series, you know it is not your typical sitcom. It deals with complex and interesting issues (particularly in the episode \"The Little Things\") and characters that are well expanded beyond specific stereotypes. As the story moves on, it is almost becomes depressing and sad. The relationships between the characters develop, and fall apart, and come to new realizations.Another aspect of the show I enjoyed was that it was set in 1980 through 1981. I really like the early 80's but hate the late 80's. Picking to start from this time period was a good choice. I loved The Jerk, Stripes, and The Who references, hehe. But do not expect this to be like Happy Days or That 70's Show, it is about relationships and uses the setting as a background, not something that pushes the plot and characters around!If I had to complain about one thing, it would be that the seasons never really change. It always feels like summer, and from someone who has lived in Michigan their whole entire life, this definitely is not true! We have extremely harsh winters and wet - often very cold - springs.In conclusion, Freaks and Geeks ended up being a good purchase. It would have been nice to have a Second Season but this will due. I can see my family and me rewatching this show.</td></tr><tr><td>Looks like Tribest \"fixed\" the overheating problem by reducing the temperature to 95 degrees. It looked like such a cool design! I should have read the reviews First. I've learned an important $60 lesson. After 5 phone calls and 2 emails, they have not answered either since December 18. Looks like they are failing. Don't Buy!</td></tr><tr><td>Ill let you know when this thing takes a s*** on me, its fast and cheap like you can see.</td></tr><tr><td>When ordering this product, it should look the same as what is shown, when I got my package it did not look anything like it was advertized.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like it and think this is the best bed for my senior dog. I still have her old fluffy bed and she switches off using beds. I'm hoping she will start to use this bed full time. Kept the old bed for my other young dog.</td></tr><tr><td>*sob*, I've tried every grind on my grinder, I've packed it, I've packed it less, I've not packed it, I've put it in both positions in My Hamilton Beach and the water still runs out of the machine.  Anything that makes it into the cup looks like weak tea and I won't discuss the taste.  No, don't ask me, I won't.  I could have been knee deep in actual coffee pods for the amount of coffee I've wasted.  I'm so disappointed.</td></tr><tr><td>As a nineties kid, this case is reminiscent of my childhood. It looks just like the gameboy, it's durable. I have no problems with it. Got many compliments.</td></tr><tr><td>I like this pitcher water filter for it's footprint in the refrigerator, how good it makes my water tastes, overall good looks, and the price.  The weak spot in this product is the lid.  Mine developed a crack near the handle within a week of owning it.  I didn't drop the lid, though I'm not sure how the crack developed.  I went back to the store and opened two more boxes of this pitcher, and both of the lids had cracks at the same location as mine.  I wouldn't buy this product again for that reason.</td></tr><tr><td>Nice and light, blocks the sun like I wanted but light enough to Velcro and not fall off. Perfect size too.</td></tr><tr><td>I like this achor, it's pretty good. I wasn't too sure about chain style anchors due to bolt cutters getting to them but I guess they would need to get to both sides of it to loosen up but it's easier to just cut the chain instead for faster get aways. I hate the drill bits that came with it. They are super cheap and they can't drill for nothing(really), It took me 4 hours of pain, even with a powerful drill. I suggest investing in your own drill bits!</td></tr><tr><td>I like it for the price and my daughter dropped my phone since having this. I am glade it work</td></tr><tr><td>My puppy just loves this thing! She destroys all of her toys we ever buy her and she has yet to damage this. It's a little stiff and hurts to get hit with while playing but does it's job. Would recommend to anyone with rough dogs that like to play or tear up toys</td></tr><tr><td>I have a belt that looks just like this.  I was so excited to get it for an early Christmas present from my hubby.</td></tr><tr><td>It looked like a great idea, but I had to send it back. I could not get the battery case open. There was a tiny screw holding it closed and nothing I did worked to get it to move.</td></tr><tr><td>Be honest I don't particularly like the look of this pair, but they are really comfortable. The thickness of the foam feels just right.</td></tr><tr><td>I met my required. It was in time and very nice. I like it. If I need, I will purchase one more time.</td></tr><tr><td>This lock and cable combo workes like a charm. I did not experience any issues whatsoever during my recent travel.</td></tr><tr><td>After a few minutes with a jeweler's screwdriver, this little joystick can bring an N64 controller back from the dead. Party like it's 1997 all over again!</td></tr><tr><td>NICE cable we are using as an extension for PS3 and 360 charging cables.  Really like the quality receptacle style connector. Holds firmly and looks nice (not cheap)..</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this for my wife to replace her old super cheap plastic cover which didn't fit properly and caused her issues with turning on the screen.This one fits her phone like a glove, Amzer does some good stuff for the money compared to many others.Pros + Fits greatCons - None</td></tr><tr><td>Bought this to use with a LED TV new to the home and it works wonderfully. There have been no issues and I look forward to using it in the future. When plugged into the laptop and TV it works nearly instantly, just had to select HDMI 1 on the TV menu. The laptop/notebook computer can be used like a DVD player and the picture on the TV is larger and very clear.</td></tr><tr><td>I like the 'bus' bars on the board that make it easy to power your devices.  There is a little bit of assembly required (the jacks at the top) that that is trivial to do.</td></tr><tr><td>Can't believe Amazon is one of the only places you can still buy this wonderful cereal. It was my favorite during elementary school. This cereal has not changed at all and still tastes 100% like I remember it. If I ever get Alzheimers, I would like someone to feed me this so my memories have a chance at coming back. Thanks Post!</td></tr><tr><td>If you like licorice flavor and have digestion problems, this might work for you too!  It tastes great (if you like black licorice.)</td></tr><tr><td>I am totally satisfied with this product.The features are excellent with ten power settings, a defrost button, a stop button, and the all important removable crumb tray on the bottom.The length and breadth of the toaster slots allow for oversized pieces of bread and or other pastries to be placed in the toaster fairly easily.The defrost function is also excellent, particularly those who like to freeze and save certain bread products like hamburger/hotdog buns, bagels, english muffins, and the like. It consistently defrosts just about everything dang near perfectly.This toaster is a bit big though but not at all heavy, my only warning is to be careful of the metal rim lining the toaster slots since it is very easy to accidently burn your self on those while removing something from the toaster.</td></tr><tr><td>It was horrible  and cheap and I did not like it it was stupid  no one should buy from them</td></tr><tr><td>ink dried way too quick and i felt like i had to change the way i gripped the pen to get it to write well</td></tr><tr><td>High winds here in WNC a couple of weeks ago brought down some mammoth size trees in the woods where I hike and short of carrying a chainsaw many miles, I needed something to help me clear my paths.  This saw did the trick.  I've got a saw blade just like this on my SOG multitool only alot smaller that I'd used to cut limbs about 6 inches thick.  This baby went through limbs 10 to 12 inches thick like warm butter.  Some woods are softer and easier to cut through but even the harder woods succumb to this blade.  I had to saw through a black cherry log about 12 inches in diameter that took some work but this little saw did it with some elbow grease.  It's a great pruning saw and is easily carried with you on a hike, camping, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>It is a Good TV. I like it very much and i got it on time. I so am happy.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great pedometer. It works in my pants pocket, jacket pocket and even my sock! I like this because I don't want something clipped to my belt... I've already lost a pedometer that way. This piece is accurate too. I like the 7 day history and the conversion from steps to miles and calories. I've tried several iPhone pedometer aps and they just don't stack up. I like this so much that I bought a second to give as a gift to my girlfriend.</td></tr><tr><td>It's a very beautiful case! When you're out in sunlight, it seems like it's glowing! It's a very beautiful blue and a silver background behind the black casing which reflects the light and makes it look like the flowers are glowing. It's saved my IPod from disaster a few times, and you can see where it's had chips taken out of it from hitting the ground.After awhile though, the rub, and wear takes it's toll, and the paint and design on it starts to chip off. Good thing it's so cheap! The design and paint did last me awhile none the less, a good year before it finally chipped off enough where it looked bad.</td></tr><tr><td>I have a 10 month old golden retriever and this product, while I liked the bottom opening for easy loading of food/treats (some toys dont even have that), the rope is not very long lasting for a heavy chewer. It only lasted &lt; 24 hours before the strands got unraveled and i had to cut it off. Now i'm just using the bottle itself as a food/treat dispenser, which is just like a Kong Wobbler. My dog, after just 2 days with it, has already figured out how to get the food out as quickly as possible - by grabbing the bottom of the bottom with his mouth and lifting it upside down. Putting large treats or pingpong balls inside will help make it more challenging.</td></tr><tr><td>It appears to be a great cover, fits well, good appearance, light not bulky but unfortunately I'm not going to be keeping the Mot Defy XT phone...but may try another Asmyna cover again when I get a phone I like better.</td></tr><tr><td>VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY CHEAP DONT PURCHASE... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY & IT TOOK LIKE 3 WEEKS TO FINALLY GET IT A PIECE OF CHEAP MATERIAL SMH</td></tr><tr><td>When I saw how many positive reviews it gets, I was surprised.I own previous Logitech wireless trackman for couple of years,had no problem with it, except receiver size.When I saw good deal on M570, i decided to try it ( unified receiver YEAY!)The minute I unpack it, I knew it goes back.While it looks attractive on the pictures, in real life it looks and feels like EXTREMELY CHEAP product from noname brand.Plastic looks cheap with no finish at all, additional buttons - looks like they will fall out after few days.Good, because it will be still on warranty :)Tracking ball itself was not rolling smooth, nothing to compare to old wireless or wired trackballs.Yes it is light, but IMHO for trackball it is negative quality, it is not a mouse, you don't need to move it on the table, it should stay firmly at place you put it.Logitech should be ashamed of putting it's name on this product.</td></tr><tr><td>the reason I didn't leave 4 stars is because even when fully tightened the trigger is too sensitive, making it difficult to attach it to the dloop because it keeps opening. But I do like that the length is adjustable, also I don't think I will get a leather release again.. when you draw the bow the tension stretches the leather.. the first time I had it too loose and it almost slide off my wrist, I have never had that with other types.</td></tr><tr><td>Pros:* Update weekly programming over the internet - it's a LOT easier to establish an initial operating schedule when your web browser gives you a calendar-like interface to program with* Remote control via iPhone* Super-easy interface with a really handy ability to temporarily override the programmed setting for either 2 hours, 4 hours, or indefinitely* Simple to useCons:* Need power from the furnace or an adapter (or this might be a pro if you already have a power line from the furnace, since it doesn't need batteries)* I had a two-year old iPhone that I had never updated and needed to update the iPhone operating system in order to install the app - that was a pain* Outdoor temperature is often not correct, probably because it's taking the outdoor temperature from an internet site that does not have accurate information for my area</td></tr><tr><td>Comb serves its purpose.  Good quality.  Small like all mustache combs.</td></tr><tr><td>I fell in love with this clutch at first sight! I was glad that it looked just like the picture. I bought a purse at the same time but i love this clutch and get a lot of compliments when I take it out at the grocery store! Its really beautiful and I plan to get another one.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this at the recommendation of Teri LaFlesh, author of Curly Like Me. It may work for her but I wasn't pleased with it. The smell isn't too great either. Seems like any other conditioner. I used this alot while trying her method. I tried some others from her book as well. Something caused my hair to become dry. It's still breaking off.It probably should be rinsed out instead of left in.</td></tr><tr><td>really like the product, better quality than i expected, definetly recommend someone to purchase , only concern was how long it took for me to get the product .</td></tr><tr><td>I chose 5 stars because this product met every expectation. I like the brightness and color temperature. And I would recommend this product and store to someone else.</td></tr><tr><td>Fits perfect in 5 gallon Pittsburgh Paint bucket.  Not sure if it is necessary for washing, but I like it.  If you like washing cars, you should get one.</td></tr><tr><td>I may have a big head (not sure) but it doesn't quite sit right on my head- it is very good quality though nice and tight stitching. But doesn't look like the picture looks like more of a regular beanie</td></tr><tr><td>Bought this because It seemed like a good value and it is relative to the packets, also less wasteful on the environment. The flavor is hard to describe, sort of a really sweet lemon with a weird fish/plastic aftertaste, I find it unpleasant. Mind you I'm not a picky person I drink black coffee and many unsweetened things.Honestly for the money I feel like thisBarlean's Organic Oils Fresh Catch Fish Oil, 8-Ounce Bottleis a better buy because there is much more EPA & DHA per serving. It does taste a bit more fishy but also tastes more natural.I would personally rather choke down something more fish flavored with natural orange flavors than weird artificial like flavors. Side note I hate the taste of glycerin and that's what makes up the vast majority of this product.</td></tr><tr><td>I originally got this as a side gift for my friend to use with the main present. SO glad I forgot about this when wrapping it up! I decided to use it just to charge my iPod.. plugged the unit in and *poof* a spark. Replugged it in again and same thing. Now, go figure it doesn't work in any outlet.. It's not even the one pictured.. Never really experienced anything like this.</td></tr><tr><td>Like the other reviewers, I agree that watch winder is very well built and luxurious.  It has a heavy solid wood cabinet with nice hinges that are smooth.  The mechanisms can all be turned on separately and adjusted to many different winding patterns.  Plenty of room for even the largest over-sized watches.  It is larger than I would have expected, but the size just makes it seem nicer really.  Be sure you have a relatively large space and an outlet for this thing.  It runs on an adapter, not batteries.  Has the finish quality far above what I would have expected for the price.  Perhaps the only drawback is that there is no storage for other watches.  So far so good.  Hopefully the motors will last.</td></tr><tr><td>Very sturdy and heavy duty built. Weight is quiet heavy but it's ok considering the type of material and construction of this maglite. Although when I was shopping for it, it did mention that there was no spare bulb included so I purchased a separate spare bulb. When the item arrived it has an included spare bulb in the package. Which was a good thing. The not soo good is spending for another spare bulb which is quiet expensive too. Overall I like this product. Can also be used for self defense.</td></tr><tr><td>Works as advertised, no problems. small and compact, accurate, doesn't have pieces that easily bend when used like some of the other gauges out there do.</td></tr><tr><td>This product does not work like the ads show. Neither my husband nor myself could actually get it to chop up hamburger.  I bought it because we both have had Gastric Bypass Surgery so we need our burger chopped up very fine but if burger is even slightly browned on one side, it won't cut thru it!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  STICK WITH YOUR GOOD OLD FASHIONED SPATULA!Strictly a product review. Shipping etc... was fantastic.</td></tr><tr><td>I got this for my brother as a stocking stuffer. He saw it on Amazon and loved it right away so I got it for him. It is very nice, it just looks more like a cup than a shotglass because it is kind of big.</td></tr><tr><td>I have had this set for about a year now. Everything has held up well. I bought the set for the straining feature which I have found useless. On more than one occation I have attempted to strain food w/ the lid and have ended up butning myself of just accidently let the lid fall off then the food falls in the sink! It would be a great feature if the lids had some kind of locking feature for people like me :-D Overall nice set of pots on a budget.</td></tr><tr><td>The case was great, took along time to get it about a month but then again it shpped from china & im in california, the little beads or stones on the bow fell off quickly but i like the way it holds together</td></tr><tr><td>I just purchased a 5 lb. container of this because my neighbors cats will not stay out of my back yard and I am tired of playing hop-scotch around cat poop and cleanup.  After putting a lot of shake away in the areas that the cats loved the most, I looked out my sliding glass door after an hour and they were resting right on top of the shake away just like it wasn't there.</td></tr><tr><td>Great quality for the price and heavy duty.  Didn't think the circuit breaker was of any use but it actually did a perfect trip on an overheating and jammed saw saving the saw and a trip to the main panel.  Socket in handle is really tight fit for devices you plug into it which is also perfect - they stay in while you drag the lamp around...  Noticed the socket's face ends with the handle shape that would prevent large plugs from fitting snug against it but they still worked ok and stayed in while not exposing much of the prongs to be an electrical hazard.  Happy.  Expect it to last 30 years like the smaller one it replaced.</td></tr><tr><td>LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My 19 month old son loves opening up the grill, playing with the hot dog, and opening and closing the doors on bottom. He even climbs inside and plays peek-a-boo. I do like that its big enough to be a fun toy, but doesn't take up your whole house. I definitely recommend this for summer time!</td></tr><tr><td>I've tried other remote controls for my cameras before, but found them unreliable. This one works so well that it makes taking photos of myself or group photos of my family easy. I like that you can do test shots to get the settings right while the device is on the camera. Then, it's a snap to use the remote. Glad I bought it.</td></tr><tr><td>These are adorable & look like little perfume bottles :) Yes they are not made of glass BUT unless you're planning on hitting them with a stick or slamming them against a wall or squeezing them roughly they seem strong enough. I have some similar looking feeders that are actually glass & these don't look much different. My hummers will be here any day now & I'll be waiting to see if they enjoy these as well. Been feeding hummers for many years, & tried many diff. types, colors, shapes & sizes of feeders & in my opinion they will luv these. I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because they smell very strongly of plastic so had to rinse several times with white vinegar to rinse them.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like these coasters.  They don't slip on my granite counters or wood furniture and are easy to clean.</td></tr><tr><td>The battery works perfectly. Batteries like this do not maintain a charge over time, so one has to keep it charging all the time or remember to make periodic charges to be sure the lantern will work when the big storm takes the electricity out. The concept of a rechargeable emergency lantern is a bit flawed. The battery is fine.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a must have for all you nail polish lovers out there. You get 24 polishes and so many colors for a very low price making in just over one dollar a piece where else can you get a deal like that? No where ! Think of all the color combinations you could do and funky designs you could make.</td></tr><tr><td>We didn't realize it until Xmas day, but we had both gotten each other a Movado. She got me a Juro and I got her this one. We're both very happy Movado-for-life customers. This is her 3rd (least expensive) Movado and she's absolutely thrilled with it because she didn't have anything simple and silver/black. She says it wears more like a comfortable bracelet. And to top it off, this exact watch (no not with the diamond) was at a local Movado store in the city for over 3 times the amount Amazon is asking!!! That's insane that Amazon can sell these so cheaply - best price on the net for Movado. Keep it up Amazon!</td></tr><tr><td>I'll start by saying that I love Eminence products for the most part.  But not this stuff.  I want a night cream that pours moisture into my skin and leaves it feeling soft and luxurious.  This cream doesn't do that for me.  It feels sticky, and like it just sits on top of my skin.  It's the only Eminence product I have tried so far that made my (dry and somewhat sensitive 40-something) skin kind of red and blotchy...probably I reacted to either the jubube stuff or the tangerine.  If you want a cream that makes everything feel tightened up, then this might work for you.  But I really recommend you get a sample first, before you put the money out.  I will stick to the blueberry soy night cream in the same line, it is awesome and feels like it just feeds the skin rather than sitting on top of it.</td></tr><tr><td>Seems to work well, but I would have liked to have known it has a coconut-like scent. I am not sure why this isn't described somewhere on the bottle.</td></tr><tr><td>If you are looking at this review you probably already know the story of the fim, Maniac.  A film you have to see to believe.  A sampling of the things that happen in this 1933 film: A woman is brought back to life, an unemployed actor kills an insane scientist, a man plucks out a cat's eyeball then eats it, a crazy man is injected with Super Adreniline, a man rapes the woman who was brought back from the dead, there is nudity, there are misspelled words in the pseudo scientific inter-titles, a man is walled up ala Poe's the Black Cat, etc.  AND, this all happens in 51 minutes!Alpha's release is not great, but watchable.  If you are curious about this title, then spend the $....  If you like it, then wait and perhaps some company will release a nice print.  As I suspect this will be unlikely, go ahead and take a gamble on the Alpha release.  There are no extras on the disk and is contains only 4 chapter stops.  Hey, what do you expect for $...?</td></tr><tr><td>I recently ordered a Samsung 3D television and this (along with a 3D bluray player) was offered free with the purchase.It is great to get all of these movies and the glasses in a bundle.  Despite several reviewers' dislike of the glasses not being rechargeable, I actually like it.  The batteries seem to last a long time, and I like having the ability to just pop in a new battery when the old one dies, rather than waiting for my glasses to charge.  My only complaint is the lack of a case for the glasses (but they do come with cloth to clean the lenses)*IMPORTANT NOTE* : the details on this page say that this product comes with vouchers for some of the movies, but this is no longer true.  All 5 movies (four shrek movies and megamind) come in the box.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a fantastically built toy.  It is durable and not easy to chew due to its shape, unlike starmark's version of this.My lab mix puppy loves the toy, figured it out quickly and gets excited when I put his kibble in it.  It is cute to watch him repeatedly hit it with his paw to get kibble out.The only problem is, after about 4 days--he is a PRO at this and can empty it in about 7min. flat and then he will bark at it, attempting to make it refill =)  I wish there was a way to alter the difficulty, like the starmark product.Overall, good puppy toy, I used it in conjunction with other kongs, squirrel dude, planet dog eggplant toy, everlasting fun ball, and a tire toy I stuff and freeze.  However if you are looking for something that will entertain for long durations on its own, this likely isn't for you!</td></tr><tr><td>Works fine and fits my Casio like the first one that came with the unit.  No problems so far.  Pleased</td></tr><tr><td>I completely stripped all the bluing of my pistol and followed the instructions in detail.  Firstly, it does blue the gun. It looks very good, and looks like it did when it was new.  The problem is, pulling it in and out of the holster for 1 week actually removed the bluing in one small spot on the slide. It is a good thing I have the Birchwood Casey bluing pen so I can touch up spots that get worn. So keep that in mind when you use this.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this for monitoring a large deep freeze with beef in it.  I originally had ordered a wireless thermometer / freezer alarm but it did not work and was returned.This thing is pricey but I am VERY pleased with it in the short time I have had it.  It has a high and low temp alarm, is very accurate, and does not show temp swings from opening the freezer.  I could have gone with the smaller display version but this thing gets my eye every time I come in the garage so I don't forget to check it.  The quality seems very good, it has multiple mounting methods and does what I bought it for.  I don't have to worry about it loosing a wireless connection like the ACU_RITE Refrigerator/Freezer Wireless Digital Thermometer 00986 that I returned.</td></tr><tr><td>Got this case as a Christmas gift for someone i hope they like it because i do and i love it</td></tr><tr><td>This produce is excellent: it goes on very smoothly, has an SPF 55 and doesn't feel like it, and covers those darn spots and red places without making a person look they dipped their face in a paint can.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like general design of the tablet. It could be more lighter but it is still one of the lightest tablet with respect to its size. I find windows RT very responsive. If you use computers for only browsing and document editing, asus vivo rt would be a great choice. I expect low number of applications in the store will sharply increase in a short time. With Dock station it is something like a good netbook.</td></tr><tr><td>It cost 7 days from ordering to delivery. And I spent 4 hours assembly it by myself alone. The product is good and worth the price.I didn't have the situation like missing components or scatch or something. And the plastic drawer slides work as expected (there is a pair of plastic drawer slides and a pair of irony keyboard slides. Both work well)Of course there are flaws. Maybe the desk I ordered is as new as just manufactured from factory, there is a heavy smell of chemicals. I have to put it just beside the window in the room to get the smell away. It may take a couple of days.Overall, it's a 5 star product.</td></tr><tr><td>...that went together like a snap!  It has been tooled to perfection and the directions were very precise and readable  (unlike some other products I've attempted to put together).  The little details are worth the price.  A similar item at the local hardware doesn't measure up to this one.  A very attractive little house when finished.  The nicest part for me was how all the pieces/parts fit together exactly with no fuss and no muss.  I would definitly buy this product again.......worth every penny.</td></tr><tr><td>I have a cocker spaniel and two great danes, one is allergic to all kinds of things and has a sensitive stomach. I give these to all my dogs. They help with stomach upset and diarrhea. They are a little on the hard side but that sure doesn't stop my dogs from eating them. They love them and eat them up like treats. When they see me open the bag they come running. I give a half chew to my cocker and 2 chews each to my danes.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like it.  I am always cold, especially at work on the waterfront.  This helps keep the chill off.</td></tr><tr><td>My children are 6 and 7 year old boys.  They will watch Power Rangers on TV, but didn't seem interested in pretend play with this toy.  It was a nice Christmas present for them to open, but they never came back to it.  I would move on to something simpler like Kinetic Sand or Legos.  Children will play all day with things like that!</td></tr><tr><td>This item was not what I expected. The picture on Amazon is not what it looks like IRL. It also arrived damaged.</td></tr><tr><td>i like stallone and mr T. have seen this movie a lot, but wanted to have it in my collection. stellar performance and i would recommedn it to one and all</td></tr><tr><td>I've been looking for a solid furnace filter for years. I hate the ones that feel flimsy and would fall apart before they pay for themselves. This filter from boair feels like it will last for a century. I like the idea of the lifetime warranty too. Awesome product!</td></tr><tr><td>This stool is very well built. I like the fact that the seat can be cleaned and won't be ruined by greasy work environment.</td></tr><tr><td>I don't know why the kids love these so much, but they can't get enough. I think they like the challenge of seeing who can handle them.  VERY popular with the kids.</td></tr><tr><td>I LOVE THIS ALBUM!  You will tooo, his voice is so addicting and unliek no other.  He's not really like Clay Aiken but I like him and Clay Aiken.  They're both good, I mean they definately should both be successful.  I know Bo will do good.  I love his first single, The Real Thing.</td></tr><tr><td>I love the soothing cucumber scent it is gentle and dissapates after use.  I feel like I am pampering my body when I use it.  I can see and feel immediate moisture without feeling greasy.</td></tr><tr><td>I use this to lock the waterproof case that I use to transport my DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ UAV.  You can find more photos and videos that I have posted here http://goo.gl/cjnwSh .  What's great about this lock is that TSA has a special key and can open it to inspect luggage, without having to know the combination.  When waiting at baggage claim, etc. the lock helps to better ensure that unwanted hands won't open your luggage.  This is important for me, as I travel with expensive video equipment and like to keep it as secure as possible.</td></tr><tr><td>He going to return the watch. He did not like the small size of the face. In fairness I didn't check the dimensions of the product.</td></tr><tr><td>No snotsucker works like Nosefrida, and as a mother of 4, I've tried them all!  Everyone knows the bulb is terrible, the battery operated ones don't have enough suction, and the comfy nose fell apart.  This is my go-to baby shower gift, and is with me whenever my kids are!!!</td></tr><tr><td>this thing turned my dell studio from a deadbeat zombie laptop to a much faster, much much faster, laptop. it's like I purchased a new laptop for that matter. I was concerned before buying this that I wouldn't be able to install it, but it was as easy as 1 2 3. or maybe it's just me.</td></tr><tr><td>I am from the East coast and this was part of my childhood. There is nothing like it. Have it on crackers with peanut butter for a special treat. Makes awesome fudge!</td></tr><tr><td>This Flash drive was pretty good. But like all great things it came to an end when it reached corruption. I bought this many years ago so my memory of how long it lasted was hazy at best.Just goes to show you to always safely remove your flash drives and treat them with good care.</td></tr><tr><td>This Vitamin C serum contains Vitamin E & ferulic acid, just like a VERY expensive ($100+) and highly-touted serum from Skinceuticals. However, Mad Hippie's serum costs only a fraction of the price.This serum is vegan and cruelty-free - the serum itself is slightly cloudy and goes on slippery. It absorbs/dries very quickly into a silk-like texture, leaving the skin instantly feeling softer and smoother than 'plain' skin. For me, 4-5 drops each morning after cleansing works best. The serum doesn't pill under moisturizers or sunscreen, nor does it leave any sort of sheen on the skin. The smell is light and fresh, and smells citrusy, but not like lemon juice. It's pleasant and not at all overpowering.To me it works great - the first week of use, I noticed that my skin appeared brighter and more even. Over time, I've noticed a reduction is dark marks from PIH and a lot of improvement in my undereye circles. I'm on my second bottle now, and can't see myself trying anything else.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like this mix. It makes very crispy waffles and pretty good pancakes. I made waffles for my family using this mix and they loved them.However....I personally prefer a heavier/breadier pancake and waffle, like those made with Bisquick. This mix, no matter how I've varied the recipes, tends to make thin, crispy products. The waffles are very light and crispy. The pancakes are more crepe-like.And making biscuits didn't turn out too well. I had too use 1/2 the butter called for because using the full amount (as written on the Pamela's website) resulted in a buttery crumble. Using 1/2 the butter made a less buttery crumble that sort of stayed together.All that said, I do like this mix. BUT I recently found the Pamela's Scone and Biscuit mix and tried making pancakes with it using roughly the same measurements as this mix. They were fantastic! In fact, very similar to Bisquick style- thick, bready and tasty.If you like heavier pancakes and waffles, I recommend using the scone mix instead.</td></tr><tr><td>I still have these in my lawn. They are not as bright as cable or powered run lights. Sometimes the solar lights are off for unknown reason. It can give a good soft light touch to your house but nothing like u see on Home magazines.</td></tr><tr><td>I've never had any visible effect from any of the longer-term (7-day or 1-month) Whitestrips kits, so I was hopeful for this kind.The Good:- The gel is thick and sticky, and the strips stay on your teeth really well, without as much foamy peroxide goo leakage as the other strips.- There was a slight lightening of my tooth color.The Bad:- Even though I carefully pressed the strips into the spaces between teeth and against the gumline, the lightening effect was concentrated on the middle of the tooth.  The edges and gumline remained the original yellowish color.- The \"slight temporary pain or sensitivity\" the package mentions turned out to be equivalent to getting a mouthful of new fillings and then having a set of braces tightened.  Every tooth the strips touched hurts like crazy.  I have a mild cold sensitivity because of fillings, but overall, I do not have very sensitive teeth.  These strips gave me a near-migraine level head/neck/jaw ache and I'm still waiting for the pain to fade 7 hours after taking the strips off.  Advil and Aleve haven't been able to touch it.  I'll be giving the other 3 doses in the box away.</td></tr><tr><td>Easy to install and works like  a dream. This air conditioner is quiet and efficient. Everything you need besides the screwdriver is included. It's also ultra-light - no straining back muscles getting it in the window. It also fits my old-fashioned, very wide window very comfortably.</td></tr><tr><td>Put this on my 15\" macbook pro with retina display back in September 2012. Super easy to apply, went on flawlessly, and still looks like new today. I have even gotten compliments on it asking where they could get one.</td></tr><tr><td>I've used the Jambox (standard size) in my office as a dual-purpose computer speaker and Bluetooth music player for several months. I recently picked up a Bose Soundlink Mini for home use (though I'm not a fan of Bose's speakers or marketing schemes generally), and am genuinely surprised at the difference in sound quality. I was not happy with the sound quality of the Jambox but assumed that a small Bluetooth speaker that had to share space with a chipset and battery was naturally limited. The Soundlink Mini destroyed that assumption. The Jambox has a tinny, laptop speaker-like quality, especially at low volumes (like you'd use in an office setting). The Soundlink Mini has a full and crisp sound even at low volume; at higher volumes it sounds like a speaker many times its size and actually puts out enough bass to feel. I now regret my Jambox purchase--In my opinion, the Bose is a no-brainer even at a slightly higher price.</td></tr><tr><td>I have had no problems with the cover and it works as advertised.  I read where others had issues with it blowing off or tearing, but none of that for me so far.I can see that additional tie-down points could be useful at the front and rear to eliminate any potential for blowing or tearing, but still I like it as is.  I use it on a 2002 Ford F150 SuperCrew and it fits well.</td></tr><tr><td>I've used these for a couple years and really like them. They work as promised and are the cheapest check stock I can find.</td></tr><tr><td>Had to give up diet coke due to surgery .  But I work overnight so I need my caffeine !  I like the taste of this water.  I would tell anyone to give it a try.  I am also one if those people who hates coffee and tea.</td></tr><tr><td>Exactly as advertised.I like this clip cause it makes easy access to my phone.The price is very right compared to the ones that are sold elsewhere and they are exactly the same.</td></tr><tr><td>I used to use a lot of drug store soaps like Dove and Olay and I found myself smelling really pretty but my skin not feeling the greatest even when I put my lotion on. I decided I wanted to make a switch to a more natural soap without all those harsh chemicals used as fill ins in most of those types of soap and I am glad I did. It smells nice but the smell isn't lasting which I love especially during the summer when all the buggies like to follow you around. You can feel yourself being cleaned but not striped of moisture and my skin has a nice healthy glow to it now. It's a bit pricey but it's well worth the purchase (it's also available at walmart).</td></tr><tr><td>I had looked for a paint marker that had an extra fine point for quite a while. After going through several stores locally, I decided to look online after realizing that none carried anything else besides the gold & silver. So glad I did! Although these are not AS fine as one might like, it is as close as you are going to get! The tips are super fine and are not affected with the pressure of pressing down on them in order to have the paint come out. They worked perfectly for my project, the price was great and the shipping was FAST!</td></tr><tr><td>I'm putting a lot of dishes I've inherited in storage. I bought these to keep them safe. They are well made. You will like them.</td></tr><tr><td>Our Doberman Pinscher loves these! We had to switch him from the Chinese versions and these have turned out to be a fantastic replacement! I would never go back to the other types. This jerky is not hard or brittle, and it does not look like pressed cardboard.It has the texture and look of meat, even though it is a processed product, and we have to watch how many we give our dog because he would eat nothing but these if we let him...</td></tr><tr><td>I like the smell and feel of this product.  i'm not sure if it really has any beneficial effects yet but it makes me feel good to use it.</td></tr><tr><td>I don't mind shelling out the money for this product. My wife pays more for the small bottles in the store, so I like to surprise her from time to time with these big bottles as a gift. She will be so happy this Christmas when she opens this, and so will I. Her hair always looks great when she uses this and it holds the color in her hair better IMHO.</td></tr><tr><td>good products I will buy again en the futuro tanks I recive the item en good condiciones I would like recomend this products</td></tr><tr><td>If you're looking for a white lid, like the picture shows, that sucks because it's blue. Gotta love false advertising.</td></tr><tr><td>We got 5 of these for Volunteers we use for 2 charity events conducted at the same time (for Halloween & Christmas) to help wave cars through our driveway. They certainly pay more attention to the cone lights than someone waving like a crazy person to get their attention! HA!These are just what we wanted as a Safely\\Security addition to our nighttime events!</td></tr><tr><td>I've had this faucet filter for years.  I get the replacements using the Amazon subscribe and save feature.  everything works well, and the water tastes better.  what's not to like?Recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>Ive been taking these pills to lose my moobs im on a 1200 calorie a day intake and do alot of cardio i only weigh 190  and since ive taken them ive only gotten a little burst of energy not much and pretty much the same.ive started doing  presses and bar bells to see if  that will help me. Im sure it takes a while before you see results  like anything else you got to push. Anyway just thought id share.</td></tr><tr><td>We haven't used our rack much yet, but it appears to be very well made and functional. It allows us to get into the back of our Pathfinder without too much hassle. We like the fact it does not touch the frame of our carbon fiber bikes. And another plus, I was rear ended a few days ago and the rack saved my Pathfinder and me.  Just a few scratches on the bike rack and on the hitch. The other car was totaled!  The insurance company is replacing it, but the rack is still in good shape and really not damaged. Glad the bikes weren't on it,</td></tr><tr><td>Item works like it should and is of professional quality. The line I received had a slight gouge in the PVC outer coating near the crimp zone on one end. No problems with functionality however.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this to put under my kees at night in order to sleep, as I am a back-sleeper due to health issues.  It does the trick with helping my lower back not to hurt as much.  It stays in place all night, not like trying to use a pillow which tends to move around.  Comfortable to use and good quality material.  I highly recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>My obese cat can fit into it if she curls up and that is something because most products are made for the ten lb and under cats while mine is 22 or more. We are trying to diet but still need products that are useful now. I have yet to find a pole like the old ones that hook to the wall and are sturdy wood so I am happy to find this for days she wants to hide.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this mount so that I could affix my 32\" Samsung UN32D6000, which doubles as a computer monitor, to the wall in order to free up some desk space. While I have no problem with the functionality of the mount, there are a couple of things anyone purchasing this for a TV under 36\" should be aware of:- The vertical bars that affix the TV to the wall mount extend both above and below the bezel on a 32\" TV by 2\".- The Horizontal Plate that the vertical bars attach to extends beyond the width of a 32\" TV by 2\".- The tilt function requires you to loosen 2 knobs on opposite sides of the mount, adjust the tilt, and then re-tighten them.(this is exceptionally difficult if you have large hands as the knobs are located on the vertical bars between the tv and the back plate)Now I must give this mount credit while credit is due. If you are purchasing this for a TV 40\" or bigger, you will appreciate that:- This mount is heavy duty (rated at 175 lbs.)- The mounting hardware for 99% of conceivable situations is included.- This mount (on my TV) did not block access to any of the I/O connections.While I will not be returning this item as I believe that overkill is underrated, I would recommend that anyone mounting a 32\" or even a 36\" TV look into purchasing a smaller mount. I would also like to note that the box I received this in was mangled even by UPS standards. Luckily the contents were durable enough to withstand the sub-par packaging.</td></tr><tr><td>This purchase was for my 5 year old niece that comes for a sleep over and we always go swimming when she comes.  She loved them....great for getting the child to practice swimming.  they look just like the picture and seem to be of good quality !</td></tr><tr><td>My stepson turned me on to this years ago when I stopped drinking wine because of headaches. The first time I drank it after a year, I took RU21 and no headache or foggy feeling. Kind of like I didn't drink at all!</td></tr><tr><td>These shears are exactly like every other pair of trauma sheers.  My sheers always seem to dull very quickly so I'm hoping that these will last a bit longer.  The price is right and the sheers work as well as any and every other pair I've owned, including more expensive ones</td></tr><tr><td>If you like a challenge, this is the puzzle for you. I bought two for a promotion at our art gallery and 29 artists worked on it.  All found it a challenge but it was the talk of the shop! We laminated the result  and got lots of comments from customers.</td></tr><tr><td>AFTER RECEIVING THIS PRODUCT I FOUND OUT IT WASNT A PLUG AND PLAY LIKE THEY SAID IT WAS. I NEEDED TO PURCHASE 4 PRODUCTS FROM METRIPACK TO MAKE IT WORK. ITS NOT A DIRECT FIT FOR A 2006 CHRYSLER 300C.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought the package of Distinctive 7-8\", 5-8\", 3-8\", 1-4\" wide rolled hem hemmer foot, and cannot make it work.The seam is not consistent, the fabric goes out of the path, the edge slips up instead of being folded and is not catched by the needle as it should be. Seems like a guide should be a little longer to better secure the fold, but it is just my opinion.A 6 mm hemmer foot from another manufacturer, which I have now, works great, but it makes too narrow a seam.  These feet just don't work for  me at all.Sorry, just waste of money.</td></tr><tr><td>Wanted a lid that stayed on when pouring - it probably will.....but not taking any chances! Love the design and like that I can see the contents. Nice enough for company!</td></tr><tr><td>The only thing is that you need to buy the filters separately. It only comes with one. Should not be like this,.... 6 should be supplied.</td></tr><tr><td>First of all, this is not pure black, it's dark blue trying to pass off as black.  Cheap black dye is often like that.  Secondly it's very weak.  The directions say to use 1/8th per 2lbs of wax.  I wound up using 3x more than that and it still just looked blue.  If you're looking for a proper color, don't buy this junk.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this to replace a waterpik waterflosser which had broken.  This is lighter weight and when not filled with water is more likely to fall over....frustrating but not the end of the world.  Definitely smaller space required for storage and I like the storage drawer in the unit rather than sitting on top of the water tank.  The handle feels good in the hand and the various settings work well to personalize it for the needs of the user. I would not be without some type of water jet for oral hygiene and this works well.  It is a bit less expensive than the earlier product I had so decided to try it.  The differences are not great enough to caause me to spend more money for a better known name brand.</td></tr><tr><td>The mug's conceptual design is excellent. Note that all parts except the mesh are either plastic or silicone (the o-rings).The silver ring around the collar that holds the mesh comes loose after some time and has to be re-adhered. Four stars because when I spend this much on a mug I'd like it to stay together without having to re-glue, otherwise, 5 stars.</td></tr><tr><td>These gummies taste almost exactly like a little fruit snacks that you might buy for your kids.  The texture is nearly identical as well.However, the included vitamins seem to be lacking when compared to other daily vitamins.  If I can find another brand in a gummy or chewable, I'd be going with that.  If not, I'd buy these again.</td></tr><tr><td>Very good quality stairs and prompt delivery! To my surpirse they're actually very sturdy! I especially like the removable carpet pieces that attach to the stairs for easy cleaning and grip for my pomeranian when she's going up and down them.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this case for my wife's GS3. We both had the same model for the GS2 and absolutely loved it. I don't know what Trident did to mess the design up in regards to the volume rocker, but it's terrible. Like many other reviewers of this case, the volume rocker gets constantly stuck in the up or down position -- you can't click it at all. Returning immediately.</td></tr><tr><td>Im really not a fan of black teas, but I do love the flavor of cardamon, so I thought I'd give this a try.  Im glad I did, it's a very nice tea!  It doesn't smell strongly of tea, which for some reason I find unpleasant.  Instead, it smells of a mild green tea and you can also catch the cardamon scent, and neither is overpowering.  But the best part is the taste, not bitter and not too strong.  I like that's it's an organic product too.  I couldn't say that it has any weight loss properties like those suggested, but I'm always happy to find a new great tea or coffee.</td></tr><tr><td>I have an adult foster home and I like to cook variety for my ladies.  This wok is great because you can stir fry veges or meat so easily and in just a few minutes and they don't fall through but get cooked evenly.  It's large, deep, the handles don't get in the way, and cleans up easily.  I used to do them on skewers, but they cooked unevenly.  I have several copper coated nonstick utensils now.  Buy them, you'll like them!</td></tr><tr><td>We bought this for our extremely active 2 year old, and he managed to pop this in one day. This is cheap dollar store quality plastic. We read the other reviews but figured we would try it anyway, since there isn't a huge selection of these on Amazon. Don't waste your money on this like we did!</td></tr><tr><td>I like that it's not enameled, but it really doesn't work that well.  Even a small lime can't be crushed enough to extract all the juice.</td></tr><tr><td>Really like the solar angel.It works great.I am used to paying $1.00 for these kind of solar toys locally, but I made an exception for this one.Thanks</td></tr><tr><td>I prefer a light roast coffee and this is one of my preferred brands.  If you like light roasts this coffee is nice.</td></tr><tr><td>I love Oggi. I have the matching ice bucket so I figured I'd get this product to go with it. And all I can say is WOW! It's amazing quality, doesn't leak, and has a great seal on the top. I got all the bar tools I need (aka jigger here which will be discussed) so I havn't tried to see if the cap can act as a jigger but it actually looks like the right size. The finish isn't how it looks, be sure to note the pictures from customers. But - WOW. I love it!Very very happy customer today!</td></tr><tr><td>I really like this product but I have to see my chiropractor to have it applied. The directions in the package don't really explain how to apply correctly and there is no mention of the I.T.band or how to tape it.  The tape is colorful and it stays put very well after it is applied by my chiropractor.  I have worn it on training runs where I got very sweaty and it stayed in place well.  It even stayed on when I got in my jacuzzi after a training run.  Overall, I liked the product but wish it had better instructions for application.</td></tr><tr><td>It will not snap completely on the itouch which is very disappointing since we really like to look of it.</td></tr><tr><td>Really like this mixer.  I do a huge amount of baking with a hand mixer. The speed adjusts according to the product you have in your bowl so that the settings are always consistent.  The first speed is nice and slow and won't splash anything while the higher speeds have plenty of power.  Nice surprise having not only the beaters but a whip in there too.  Maybe I didn't read enough but I didn't realize that was part of the buy.  The swivel cord is great and never gets in the way and the beaters pop out easily.  For some people, though, this might be a little on the heavy side for a hand mixer.  I have a lot of strength in my arms so that's not an issue for me but could be for others.</td></tr><tr><td>My kitten absolutely loved this toy!  She carried it around everywhere, and growled and ran away if I tried to take it.  I noticed she like to chew on it, but i didn't think she could actually eat it.She was only 6 months old when she managed to swallow the whole ball, developed a bowel obstruction and had to have surgery to remove it.  The vet gave me the fur ball removed from her bowels.Cats love this toy, but never let them play with it unless you are watching the whole time.</td></tr><tr><td>This item is okay for the price paid. I have dropped my phone and it received no damage. I like this case.</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent product. I like how big it is so I can do a lot of lettuce at once. And its fun and easy to use.</td></tr><tr><td>As i said we still use the old one to keep things warm. Trusting this will last 10 years plus. try it you will like it. Service at Amazon was again WONDERFUL. Package came in a few days Very well packed ******** We will buy from Amazon AGAIN and Again</td></tr><tr><td>Good size for larger keyfobs with a strong magnet to hold it in place. I like this a lot. Its good quality and it fits snug inside of my hitch on my truck, without being seen.</td></tr><tr><td>I feel that i can see actual results. I can also feel the effect on my scalp.I like the product</td></tr><tr><td>This fits in the bay for the optiplex ultra small form factor. I had an extra D bay drive and it didn't fit in the bay of my optiplex 755. So I decided to try this and it fit like a charm. I turned on the power and it was recognized right away by the bios. It works well and gives me the option of burning dvd's instead of just a player.</td></tr><tr><td>I was a little hesitant to order this with all the complaints about lint and destruction after washing this comforter, but after recieving it in the mail and then washing it for the first time before I used it, it came out perfect.  No lint and no fuzz.  It is too big to wash in a conventional agitator machine, so I had to go to the laundromat for a front loading one, but if that's all it will take, I was very pleased. Just wash like the instructions say....cold wash tumble dry low.  Very comfortable comforter.</td></tr><tr><td>Pros &#8211; Washable, comfortable, feels luxurious, excellent quality, looks great, beneficial for people with allergies as opposed to feather.  Cons &#8211; Pricy, does make noise when moved a lot.  I think the noise is a result of stiffness when new but using after 1 month it is not as noticeable and does not bother my wife and I.  I like the comforter enough that this is my second.  It would be nice if there were color choices, even 6 solid color offerings would be better than just white.</td></tr><tr><td>This compilation, along with all the other Fat Wreck compilations is  really really good.  If you are a new owner of this CD, i would recommend  listening to Lagwagon, No Use For A Name, Good Riddance, and Frenzal Rhomb  first.  But its definitely a great CD as a whole.  The only downside is the  Swingin Utters song and the Wizo song, personally i can't stand either of  them but you might like em...have fun with the cd.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this hoping it would be like a case for an old phone I used to have.  It is similar, but the rubber portion is not as tight as it could be.  The buttons underneath are difficult to press through the rubber, too.</td></tr><tr><td>This product is not worth a buying.  it does not work like the picture shown so do not recommend buying it.</td></tr><tr><td>I didn't have any problems as far as smell or residue like what others have been saying. The only issue I have with it is that it doesn't stay put like its suppose to. I purchased this item to place right at our front entrance. First right. It just doesn't stay put. In addition, the end portion that was rolled on the inside is bent so it sticks up off the floor which causes people (my children) tripping over it. Great price. Not as big as i wanted but it was just right. Gets the job done by keeping dirt off the carpet in our front entrance.</td></tr><tr><td>Smells like we're backing in the kitchen.  Not one of my favorites, but it was a pleasant change around the holidays.</td></tr><tr><td>Works wonderfully in cast iron, so much better than wood or plastic.The edge can also be used to cut things up in the pan or on a griddle, watch next time you are near a short order chef cooking up gyros, philly steaks, or similar, I bet they use something like this to chop and maneuver the food on the griddle.Keep it nice by only handwashing, don't let it soak either. Occasionaly touch the wood up with some food safe oil, like olive or mineral oil.The sharp corners can be a liability, be careful not to gouge or stab.</td></tr><tr><td>Our local grocery store carries only Canada Dry tonic water in large plastic bottles.  When enjoying your favorite tonic beverage with others, that may be convenient, but it tends to lose carbonation rather quickly if you re-seal or store it.  I end up wasting a lot of tonic.  In addition, it's nice to mix up your tonic water depending on your mixing liquor and your mood.  The cans are convenient and Hansen's taste great, a bit sweeter than I was expecting, but well balanced.  The price is also right on amazon.  I'd continue to by these, but maybe not on amazon...The way Amazon packaged this ended up exploding a couple cans during shipment.  Two cans lost wasn't as big of a deal as the sticky mess I had to clean off the remaining good cans.  I'd really like a reliable and quality source of tonic water besides my local grocer, but I'm not sure I found it due to this packaging issue.</td></tr><tr><td>WORKED GREAT,VERY GOOD,I REALLY LIKE THIS BRUSH.THE WIDE BRUSH MAKES IT EASY TO DO PICTURES WHEN YOUR OUT AND ABOUT.ALONG WITH THE SMALLER BRUSH,YOU ONLY NEED 2 BRUSHES AND THEY BOTH HOLD WATER!</td></tr><tr><td>Like this.  Helps keep my iPad screen cleaner.  Does not hurt the screen.  Just have to remember to use it more.</td></tr><tr><td>The actual lantern seemed like it was pretty good.  Brightness was acceptable.  Seemed like it would light up a tent just fine.But the charger it came with looked like a BS 4573 plug, which will only work well if you happen to have access to a bathroom in Ireland.  It's a European two-prong plug, useless in the U.S.What's most disturbing is that a number of people have already complained about this.  I assumed the seller would address the issue and make sure to send U.S. chargers to U.S. customers, but clearly they are just hoping to get rid of as many of these as they can, hoping most of us are too busy to send it back.I returned mine.  If you place an order today, you may just receive it, along with a European charger.</td></tr><tr><td>Just got my new 505A Protractor.  With a name like Starrett, and the $50 advertised price, I figured I could not go wrong.  Well I did.  This is a great tool but not too well built.  Oh it is heavy enough, but for the money 90 degrees should be just that, not 89.5 or 90.5 and yes, all the other angles are off by a half degree too.  I have cheap plastic protractors that are dead on.  There is no excuse for shipping these things if they are not dead on correct.  I paid for a quality protractor and got an expensive T-bevel.  Shame on you Starrett!</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this a futon as a second sofa in my living room. The color is darker than what is shown in the picture. But overall it is a good quality futon and looks rich and I like it a lot. It is not very comfortable as a bed though. If you want to use it as a bed every day I would not recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this because of the price and I don't like the idea of a bluetooth device with a speaker hanging onto the sun visor where I'd have to flip it over depending on if the visor was up or down and where it could fall off and cause a distraction/accident. This was extremely easy to use and set up and works through the car speakers instead of having its own speaker like most of the visor mounts do. I would suggest three improvements. Make it so you can pair more than one device and allow for easy switching between devices like the OEM systems. Make the volume control separate and easier to access, Last, if possible, make it so it turns on and off with the car.</td></tr><tr><td>Needed something for the arched window in the living room. So easy to put up. The colors are perfect. Looks like a stained glass window.</td></tr><tr><td>i bought this so that i could have anothe place to put my loose change. i like the contraption, the springs sound a little flimsy and the velco provided doesnt hold the very best but it does the job. when i have it full of change will be the test for both the springs and the velcro. we'll see.</td></tr><tr><td>Ugh, I did not read the reviews first and I bought this for my son.  This thing will be broken in no time if I give it to him.  Though it is a very study product, it is just a board (like particle board type material) with one side coated white, and no trim/frame. Also, the ink does not wipe off completely.  I wrote on it and then wiped it off, now the board has an orange tint.  This will become a note board for the kitchen.</td></tr><tr><td>Do not like this case. It comes off of my phone a lot. It doesn't slide into my pocket easily either.</td></tr><tr><td>Why does the information about the quantity not listed by amazon? I would like to know how much titanium white is being sold before i buy it....</td></tr><tr><td>Love the size and weight of this. It covers to the floor like the old bedspreads, meaning if I want to stash something under my bed I can do so without having it show or putting it in a box. Bought some cheap draperies for the 3 windows and it looks like they are all a set. Not really heavy to take the place of a comforter if you get cold but most the time in Florida the sheet and this is just right.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this backpack to cary my camera stuff in. I like it but it is a little on the small side(that I guess is my fault). I like the bag though. Has a lot of different ways of getting to your stuff.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this for my bed at college, and it turned the worst bed i have ever slept on to one of the best. This topper is very comfortable and worth every penny. Need like 2 or 3 days for the smell to get out of it, i used it after 1 and it smelled for a little bit but it was that bad and i was still able to sleep.</td></tr><tr><td>This is an attractive faucet set, which goes very well with our other brushed nickel bathroom fixtures.  It was as advertised; and it arrived when promised.  We are very pleased with this set; and we would order it again.One minor point keeps this rating from being a five.  The faucet stems for this set, like so many others, are partly plastic.  That makes them have a little play in their movement.  Don't like that; but my plumber says \"Get used to it!\"Good set; good value!dbrbjr</td></tr><tr><td>There are a few brands of instant yakisoba. So far I believe I have tried them all. This product is not low in carbs or anything like that, but if you are starving and need something quick, easy to clean up, and very tasty to eat, this is it.This is better than the UFO brand (in my opinion) and the rest are not even worth mentioning. Yes the UFO one gives you more noodles, but they don't taste as good: not nearly as savory.</td></tr><tr><td>I've bought three of these, and my experience has been pretty consistent.  My dogs really go nuts for this bone.  However, if I leave them to it for more than about 10 minutes, they'll follow up the next day with diarrhea and/or really bright yellow poop that smells just awful.Anyway, if I limit their time, or after they've worked off most of the loose stuff, it seems like a good product.  They're usually not that interested in bones, but they really like this one.I'm probably not buying any more of them, as there's plenty of tasty things out there that don't have negative side effects.Hope it helps you!</td></tr><tr><td>alright, don't get me wrong here, but the black eyed peas SUCK now a days. The guy singing most of of the lyrics voice is the most annoying voice ever not to mention the lyrics are repetitive and don't make ANY sense at all. i mean, yeah, the black eyed peas WERE good, and i used to love them with songs like where is the love, shut up and hey mama, but now it's pathetic how people are actually liking the songs. if you listened close to the songs, i'm probably sure you found that it made no sense either, which means if you like it, you're not really listening to the lyrcis, just the beats, and if you do that, you don't like the music itself do ya? you like the beats...</td></tr><tr><td>it is really nice bag... quality is good. colour is nice. i really love it.  but the only thing i don't like is inside the pocket got different colour from the bag.  i bought the Forest green but inside the pocket is light green color.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this game as a Christmas present to my newly wedded friends and it was a hit..You could almost play with any couple as the questions were based on more subjects than just sexual ones.  The rules and scoring were very easy to do and the game flows right along.  There were questions concerning your partner's favorite things or activities and memory questions like, \"what was the first movie you guys ever went to,\" or \"where was the last restaurant you ate at.\"  We loved it and will definatley play again!</td></tr><tr><td>No problem just like the one that came with the phone. Beats any phone store price. Easy to install and charged right up.</td></tr><tr><td>Jeni turns out a stunningly brilliant performance in this piece, tying up all his scattered comedic topics together by the end of the show like only he can. What a legacy.  After catching this show on cable, it was masterful to see him in person in Orlando.  Use of language not for those who blush, but it's not just vulgarly thrown in as some other comedains often do just for the sake of saying them. My 75 year-old father-in-law laughs his natural teeth off and blows his hearing aids out watching the show...Christmas present problem solved!  Keep it up Richard.</td></tr><tr><td>I can't lie and say that it tastes the best but I can say that it doesn't leave you feeling bloated like other dairy protein powders.  Just don't leave it there for too long, shake and drink.</td></tr><tr><td>I have a Dell M4600. This is a mobile workstation. This is not built to be light but built to be fast and reliable with plenty of cooling for long days of work. My concern was if this stand would be able to support this laptop which is so much heavier than most apple laptops. It shines. This stand is rock solid. I also have some heavy video cables running from the back to a second monitor but the stand still feels like it is glued to the table.The design is also beautiful so I'm a very happy camper!</td></tr><tr><td>Reeks of clove oil and all spice. Nothing like the true thing. I would save the money and try one iPod the many other options on amazon</td></tr><tr><td>Works well in my Seiko kinetic watch! the length of time it will hold it's charge is yet to be determined, however, it looks like the the factory equivalent!</td></tr><tr><td>smells just like it i have no more to tell. would buy again for sure. long lasting all day long.</td></tr><tr><td>I take my lunch to work every day.  I don't use the insert to warm up foods.  What I like is the little pop-up at the top for air.  I have other Sistema products.</td></tr><tr><td>I have been using these for almost a month now and I have seen a massive improvement in my arms. I use them for just about every lift I do and you can feel a major difference. Using these I had to drop my weight(curling 40lbs down to 25lbs with grip on one example) but i still felt like I got an awesome workout. Using these on an EZ-Curl bar really makes you feel it in your forearms.My only complaint would be they are alittle to long and i only say this becuase the gyms I use have raised area on either side where you grip the wieght. I simply marked them and cut them down and now the work great.</td></tr><tr><td>I do not like this cream.  It's super heavy (which I guess it is because it is a cream) but if I itch my face or anything a couple hours after applying, it gets bally and has particles that come off.  You can not put it on and then apply foundation, and I use bare minerals concealer.  Really disappointing for the price.  I didn't use it long enough to see if it actually gives results.</td></tr><tr><td>Ever since my winter vacation started, I've had trouble sleeping before 4AM and waking up before noon time. I would go to bed at midnight and end up tossing and turning for hours and I hated it. I bought this a couple days ago and took it an hour before going to bed and I immediately began to feel its effects. I woke up in the early morning feeling refreshed and great. I can definitely vouch for this product if you're like me and just want to have a normal sleeping cycle again.</td></tr><tr><td>The picture shows Slash-proof wire-reinforced strap protects against theft but the 1 that i received didn't have it. I like the bag but it is false advertisement.</td></tr><tr><td>This product works! I had my doubts but the auto switch works between my three devices like a charm. I am running a u-verse receiver and Samsung DVD Blueray player, through the switch to my Samsung soundbar and then out to my LCD TV. I only rarely have to use the remote to manually select the HDMI channel.</td></tr><tr><td>The cart is made of beautiful sturdy wood.  It looks beautiful but I have had nothing but problems with the adjustment features.The Tilting Brace that allows you to adjust the tilt of the top tray has a plastic knob that snapped the first time I tried to tighten it.  The vertical support has a cute little wooden knob that when I tried to raise the tray the knob screwed rigt off!  I will now have to figure out a way to remove the screw that is stuck in the vertical support and try to glue the knob back on.Another concern was the fact that when assembled it was not level...and it was not close to level.  It felt like I had to sit at an angle in order to use my laptop.I have only owned this cart for 6 days and if I didn't discard the carton I would return it for a refund.This cart is beautiful and would probably suffice if you didn't want to adjust the tilt or height very often.</td></tr><tr><td>The Metra 95-5026 Double-Din Bracket Fit my 2004 Ford Explorer and the Pioneer z130BT that I mounted in it like a glove. It didn't look very solid when I took it out of the bag but when installed it is very solid. The factory installed look is another plus. I would highly recommed this product.</td></tr><tr><td>I have trouble breathing out of my nose and I hike at altitude a lot so it's important I can breathe! I use this at night and in the evening to help me breathe better and it works like a charm. My only gripe is that they are inconsistent with giving you a nasal cup. Sometimes I get just the bottle wrapped in plastic and sometimes I get the nasal cup with the wash. Keep that in mind and don't throw your old one out just in case!</td></tr><tr><td>Xylitol isn't cheap, so I was very glad to find this 5lb bag.  The bag has a ziplock top, which works with coaxing.  The bag is also very thick so that if the ziplock didn't work, rolling it up tightly would probably work just as well.  I'm on my second purchase.I use this to help my teeth and sugar cravings.  I put several T. in an air tight container (like small vitamin bottle).  I add several drops of flavoring or oil, like vanilla, orange, lime, etc., and the flavor permeates the xylitol in the container.  then, I just eat little spoonfuls of the flavored xylitol.I've never had gastric problems, not like w other sugar alcohols.  I did accumstom myself slowly to the xylitol, but can now have as much as I want w/o trouble.</td></tr><tr><td>Cinnamon is one of Quest's best flavors. Heat these suckers up in the microwave for 7-10 seconds and they taste even better, like an actual gooey cinnamon roll. Texture is like a softer power bar and the macros can't be beat.</td></tr><tr><td>I've been taking the Kirkland Signature Nighttime Sleep Aid for about 20 years.  I always buy them at Costco as there are two bottles in a package and they last FOREVER.  You only need 1/2 a pill and they're marked so they break in half easily.  Like many others, I've tried everything on the market but always come back to these.</td></tr><tr><td>Case perfect weight and so pretty. Broke easy but got a good month or two's use out of it. JustDidn't like the stylus,It broke within a day. But it was an extra as well as the screen protector.(which I haven't used yet) but I love it&miss; it. Definitely will repurchase it.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this connector to use with a two burner propane (non-Coleman) and a small quick and easy Coleman grill.  Both are designed to use 1 lb. propane tanks.  This connector allows me to use a 20 lb. tank.  I did not have any problem connecting it to either appliance like some other reviewers commented about.  Just be mindful of that it does thread to the left to connect to the 20 lb. tank.</td></tr><tr><td>Worked on the first day with no issues but after that has major problems. I have Windows 7 x64 and drivers are included. However this had major problems and caused my entire computer to lock up. Odd things like Internet Explorer would not even open and hitting disable would not disable the adapter. Then, unplugging it caused IE to open all the Windows right away. I had issues, you may not. I'll be returning this for as much refund as I can get.</td></tr><tr><td>Its card effects aka Special Abilities are what I like the most. Though I wish I could find the original unedited japanese version of the card.</td></tr><tr><td>I've been searching for a multivitamin and this seems like it's the best. It's exactly what I've been searching for and I would recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>I've only had this fountain for a little while, but I do know that I love this fountain and so do my cats!  After buying 3 Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow Pet Fountains in 4 years (my review is on the Petmate page), I finally decided to try The Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain and wish I had done it sooner!  My cats love the stream because it's just like a stream coming out of the faucet (my male cat loves the tub faucet...I'm hoping he'll like this better).  It doesn't splash anywhere and it's VERY quiet.  It's so nice to have a fountain that doesn't leak water and a fountain where I can keep the filter in place (because the Petmate always leaked water when the filter was in place).  It's also VERY easy to clean compared to the Petmate (LOVE that!).  FYI, this fountain is bigger than the Petmate and the reservoir is huge compared to the Petmate.  Also, I thought it was going to be white, but it's actually a speckled grey/blue (which I like better).  I'm hoping this fountain will last much longer for me than the Petmate fountains did.</td></tr><tr><td>This is the BEST product for cats.  It's so concentrated that a little spray goes a long way.  I spray it on my cats scratching post and their toys.  They go crazy over it.  Not messy like the loose catnip.</td></tr><tr><td>This mic works better than the mic in the TYT uvf 1. It is smaller than I anticipated, and made about like you would expect for the price. Cheap, but works pretty well for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>My  66717 Raised Queen AirBed Air Mattress w/ built-in electric AC pump is 13 months old and has been used twice. After the first time, we blew it up and it had a \"pocket\" on the end. It was like a channel got mis-directed. It also looses air so we aren't real pleased as the warranty is out and it has been used all of two times, which is very disappointing. The good this was the electric pump that is housed in the unit made it very easy and simple to inflate.</td></tr><tr><td>I like these photo corners because they are made of paper, like the old ones, yet they are stickers, so it's easier to manipulate them. Plus, they are 252 for the price. Other brands offer less for almos the same price.</td></tr><tr><td>I really like this product line. My hair is very fine and this seems to make it thicker. I have been using it maybe 2 months now, and can't wait to see what it looks like in 4 more!</td></tr><tr><td>This intriguing puzzle was designed by Wei-Hwa Huang and Oskar van Deventer, two of the best puzzle designers around, so you know it will be both entertaining and challenging -- and it is. The goal is to stack the supplied tiles (which have various cutouts in them) together to reveal the abbreviated name of the month and the number of the day for a particular date. The tiles contain multiple slots, and can be combined in many different ways. The resulting display looks like a digital clock.The puzzle can serve as your desk calendar, since you can construct the names for all 365 days of the year from JAN 01 to DEC 31. But doing so is not always easy, since there are only four letter tiles and six number tiles to work with, and they can be combined in many ways. Some dates are easy to get, others are quite challenging. This entertaining puzzle can be played solo or by a couple of people working together. It's a great example of how an elegant puzzle can be created with a minimum of pieces and a maximum of ingenuity.</td></tr><tr><td>I recently bought this heater based on consumer reports ratings and I like almost everything about it except one thing.  The thermostat doesn't work every time.  So, half the time it is turned on, it just stays on until the room is over 90 degrees even though the desired temperature is set at 72 degrees.  I am guessing there is a defect in my unit but it seems to be a fairly common defect as I have read similar complaints on Amazon.</td></tr><tr><td>I liked this case, which I bought it in black, because it was large. I could fit 2 large sunglasses with ease. The outer covering is made of leather or vinyl-like material and interior is cream in color with sponge like material. The case closes with ease because there are hinges on the back (like we see on the doors). It does not weigh a lot but it would be slightly difficult to carry, unless you leave it in your car or purse.</td></tr><tr><td>I boil water on my stovetop with oils, for aromatherapy. I like this one with eucalyptus/clove. The fragrance is refreshing.</td></tr><tr><td>I use a lot of liners and have used Smashbox/ Stila/ Mac... this is by far the best liner I have. I buy it on here specifically because I love the product so much. I end up throwing the others out. This stuff stays and it goes on smooth. It's worth the reasonable price and I would recommend it to others looking for a great black pencil liner. I like it better than liquid and it has yet to break when sharpened. Awesome stuff...</td></tr><tr><td>THEY ARE REALLY NICE THEY HAVE A BIG ENOUGH FACE ON THEM WHERE YOU CAN SEE YOUR SELF JUST LIKE A MINI MIRROR THUMBS UP!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>The AluBase by Just Mobile is ideal to secure your MacBook Pro (or MacBook Air) and increase desk real-estate instantly.  The color match is perfect to the MBP which makes it very stylish.  Not blocky looking like Twelve South's Arc.  The AluBase is surprisingly stable for its small footprint (compared to the Arc) probably due to the weight and construction (no cheap materials here).  The base is aluminum and the part that comes in contact with the computer is a teflon like material which is very smooth and has yet to scratch my precious MBP.I partially like the fact it can sit on the edge of my desk (unlike the Arc).  The price is a little high (you get what you pay for),  but well worth the investment.  The AluBase will last a lifetime and still look stylish years down the road.  I also have a MacBook Air so if I decide to use the Air in the AluBase all I have to do is change out the teflon part (unlike the Arc) and Im good to go.</td></tr><tr><td>I have Dry Mouth and these are the best lozenges I've found .They adhere well to my teeth and cheek, and last for hours. I like the mint-free version. They last almost through the night when I sleep. They come in a blister pack so you only open one at a time.</td></tr><tr><td>Absolutely love this kettle! Yes, you have to have some water in it so it will whistle, but the whistle tone is so neat - sounds like a harmonica. And it's a beautiful kettle.</td></tr><tr><td>I like this. It's very hands on & I'm excited that my daughter likes it. I received a refurbished item though although I paid for a new one. It was not wrapped in plastic when I received it either, it was just in the box.</td></tr><tr><td>What is great about this disc burner is that while it is super easy to just burn discs with, it has a huge feature set available if you want to do a lot more than just burn copies.  LightScribe compatible and a heckuva lot more if you want to really dig in and get down and dirty.  Awesome burner at a can't-be-beat price.  Burns copies (CDs) in under two minutes, what's not to like about that?  Nice to get out of the studio a heckuva lot faster now..</td></tr><tr><td>After the potent warm-up that was &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club,&quot; Sheryl Crow came into her own with her self-titled sophomore release.  She took the production helm all by herself and the end result was a tighter,  grittier, and more consistent record.&quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot;  is a simply-perfect rock ballad, justifiably the first single; and  &quot;Everyday is a Winding Road&quot; and &quot;A Change&quot; brilliantly  showcase what is now a classic Crow approach to songwriting.  But the songs  that never made it to radio that are just as breathtaking: &quot;Hard to  Make a Stand&quot; sounds instantly like classic rock (classic, not retro);  &quot;Home&quot; is a quiet, understated ballad with country overtones and  a haunting vocal; the foot-tapper &quot;Sweet Rosalyn&quot; is so  Beatlesque it's almost a tribute; and &quot;Love is a Good Thing&quot;  (which provided controversy upon release with the lyric &quot;watch our  children as they kill each other/with a gun they bought at a Wal-Mart  discount store&quot;) unleashes such a heavy dose of funk you might, for  just a minute, think you're listening to Wendy &amp; Lisa.Elsewhere,  &quot;Redemption Day,&quot; &quot;The Book,&quot; and &quot;Ordinary  Morning&quot; are ballads that are impressive for how far Crow is willing  to stretch herself (&quot;Ordinary Morning&quot; is especially strong,  testing the limits of her vocal range and boasting a very Lennon-esque  verse), and &quot;Maybe Angels,&quot; the song that launches the project,  boasts a slow, heavy rock groove and some of Crow's most clever lyrics to  date (&quot;I took the I-95 down to Pensacola/all I found was a bunch of  holy rollers/they don't know nothin about savin me&quot;).  You'll be hard  pressed to find much fault with &quot;Sheryl Crow,&quot; an album that both  broadens Sheryl's horizons and still stays close enough to her original  path to please the masses.  Whether it's from a writing, musical, or  especially production standpoint, this a record musicians can learn from  and fans will love.</td></tr><tr><td>I was looking for some classic, large red wine glasses like some I have enjoyed in good restaurants. The big stores seem to only stock the smaller ones, 10-12 oz, so I went to Amazon.They arrived unbroken and I cracked open a good wine I had been saving for them.They don't fit in the cabinet, so I have them on a shelf. Because of the large size, they help the wine breathe, and act as a decanter. These glasses improve my enjoyment of wine, and I'm glad I got them.</td></tr><tr><td>Based on the HELLBLAZER comics, John Constantine (played like a robot by Keanu Reeves) is a demon hunter that can see demons and angels. His responsibility is to keep them in line if they go beyond what is allowed in tipping the balance between good and evil. The film revolves around detective Angela Dodson (the gorgeous Rachel Weisz) and her twin that commits suicide. She seeks the help of Constantine to determine what external forces may have played a role in her death. As they unravel the mystery they learn that her sister's death was only to draw Angela to play a part in a diabolical scheme. The concept and story are great. The supporting roles are filled by great actors like Shia LeBeouf, Tilda Swinton and check out who plays Lucifer! Keanu just kills it. He was great in the Matrix when asked to play like a robot because that's about all he is good at, lately. In Constantine, it just doesn't work. Viggo Mortensen or Guy Pearce would have made this a 4 star movie, but although the story and effects are good...Keanu brings it down a notch.NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Excellent picture and sound. All special features from DVD are here. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY!</td></tr><tr><td>The picture is Bad quality didn't look like what is in the picture. Don't buy it, it's a waste of money.</td></tr><tr><td>The stuffed dog is very cute and rather lifelike.  My mom had to give up her cocker spaniel because she was no longer able to care for him.  She missed him a lot.  We found this one online after some friends told us about other dogs by this company. This was a great hit with my mom and looks so much like the dog she had to give away.</td></tr><tr><td>I like the bling and the message, though it IS rather heavy.  I get around that by attaching it directly to my shirt instead of my collar.  Works well enough, and doesn't pull my shirt down.  So far so good!</td></tr><tr><td>I really like this small sauce pan. When I need to make a hollandaise, b&eacute;arnaise, or alfreado this is the pan I reach for. I almost did not buy it because of the \"tippiness\" that many people had reported, but now I am glad that I did. It is not a tipping hazard on a glass range even when using a whip. Though it is not quite heavy enough to avoid using the handle while using the whip, but then again the pan is 1.5qt so that should be obvious. I have a glass top range, and I can use the small number 5 burner with this right in the middle of other pots and saut&eacute; pans no problem. I highly recommend this to go with other Cuisinart chef's classic pans.</td></tr><tr><td>Desitin Creamy Ointment, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 6)I have used this product since day one with our daughter and it prevents the diaper rash as well as treats it!Would recommend this to any new parent (like us) who is completely overwhelmed by all the choices out there!</td></tr><tr><td>Decent little basket to use for gift basket. The handles seem a bit flimsy so it cannot take much weight so it would be good for a decorative basket like on a bathroom counter. I used it to put small gifts in for a baby. I figured the parents could use it to store small items in on the babies changing table or something like that.</td></tr><tr><td>This case is perfect for protecting my iPad when my kids (ages 3-7) are frequent users.  I rarely worry about the iPad because I feel secure with the cover.  And, the kids can't remove it (as opposed to typical iPad cases, that fold over like books.</td></tr><tr><td>Broke quickly within 2-3 months with minimal use. I bought this stapler because it looked like the long lasting old school staplers. Nope.</td></tr><tr><td>The color is subtle but nice.  I like this best for its moisturizing qualities.  Have purchased this twice from Amazon and will buy again in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>I had gotten these as an exchange from a set of headphones that cost twice as much. And while the sound quality is better than those headphones, these will be going back to the store as well.I have a relatively small head, so it wasn't crushing my head like other people have described. But the headband is incredibly uncomfortable, even after adjusting several times in an attempt to alleviate the pressure on top of my head. The ear pieces were just as uncomfortable.Get these only if you want great sound... by holding them to one ear like they are designed to do.</td></tr><tr><td>Have had some problem with sticking to flat disc dash mounting pad.  Overall, works like the original mount that came with the unit.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this because I don't like the regular ropes. The bearings work nicely and the rope flies. Descen't construction for the price and works just as well as the expensive ones do. It looks a little cheesy but it works just fine.</td></tr><tr><td>Ok, I confess, I've enjoyed the Dixie Chicks, but, I bought this CD, the day it was released, as a political statement.I have to say, I was Appalled, when they made a simple joke, (something like \"don't blame me, I didn't vote for him\")while in Europe, about the current president of the \"land of the free\" and \"his people\" were so thin-skinned that the actual administration rose up in hew-and-cry calling the \"Chicks\" un-American and anti-American and other nasty stuff.They ranted enough, they stirred up the haters among their following to the degree the girls got death threats ... for a simple comment about disagreeing with Mr. G W Bush!And got Screams from the administration, demanding people boycott their album, since, obviously, anyone who says they disagree with GW ...Well... I disagree that view and definitely disagree with an administration taking that kind of a stance ... so the minute I saw they were \"taking the risk\" of releasing a new CD ... I bought it ... (and I hope you will, too) as a statement of support for free speech, really.Boy, did I luck out ... not every protest is so tasty! The CD is a sweet addition to my music library ... the \"Chicks\" are at their best ... love the songs and the thoughts in them.So, if you happen to agree with everything the current administration says and does ... buy the CD for the music!If you happen to agree that free speech should be supported...buy the CD for the statement ... and luck out with great music.Just my thoughts ... your mileage may vary ... some exceptions apply ... and if this would land me on the \"with no explanation 'no fly' list\" ... I was just kidding, obviously</td></tr><tr><td>I was hoping to get higher pressure from my hose using this when brewing. It kind of just dribbled out like a hose, my cheap 2 buck nozzle worked better with more pressure. Definitely looks cool and feels solid, just doesn't perform.</td></tr><tr><td>These types of batteries only hold a charge it seems like for only 8/10 hrs. And less with any sort of serious use of your phone! It didn't solve my problem since I thought I needed a new battery since my original one didn't stay charged long with use!</td></tr><tr><td>If you like insane comedy. The kind of insanity where one naked man chases another naked man into a room of people having a meeting. The kind of insanity where a man is pretending to be from another country and cons people into doing silly stuff. If you like that kind of funny insanity, this movie is for you. There is a lot of racial slurs, nudity, homosexual undertones, violence, etc. However all of this is done in a humorous way. Borat is never to be taken seriously. Anytime someone does, anger insues.</td></tr><tr><td>This was my 4th Mad Dog DVD but not the strangest.  I couldn't wait for the class to be over.  I know, I should have muted it.  This one did have a couple of songs that you could bike too but they came at the wrong time.All of the DVDs that come from this company have a cult-like atmosphere.  This DVD provides three instructors to get to that higher ground, to reach that mountain, to let spinning help you cast aside all your problems and guide you to the clouds for salvation.I cannot fully recommend this or any of their other DVDs that I've tried.</td></tr><tr><td>My 11 and 6 year old sons love these nets.  The price is right and these are well constructed.  My sons have been using these on a daily basis and they are holding up very well.  I recommend these to anyone searching for a nice net for their children who are collecting butterflys and other insects.Update:  8/14/13We still have these nets.  My boys are now 16 and 11 and use these to catch bugs and even recently a baby bunny.  I can't believe we have had them this long and they are still holding up like new.  Definitely a good buy!</td></tr><tr><td>I read the title, but looked at the size dimensions and thought it might be a pocket size carry. Well its small and maybe you would like to carrry it but its a bit small for me, and more like a keychain light. The issue I have with Coast is the dimensions on their website doesn't always match Amazon or doesn't list the dimensions at all. With that said it is a well built light a bright considering how small it is. For a bit more $$$ though you can get a powerhouse cree light. Not buying again, but Coast is still a good company.</td></tr><tr><td>This product works well. The key is to spray once on each side of mask, quickly rinse (like your gold panning), then directly put mask on. If mask left in water the spray will quickly wear off.Stays clear for entire dive. Kept product in BC pocket and used at surface with no issue. Would buy again.</td></tr><tr><td>Run the DVD, hook it up, and forget it. It works perfectly for my IMac, 3 external HDs and a router during the short power outages we have experienced to far. Just like it is supposed to do.</td></tr><tr><td>I'm quite pleased with this little unit. I'm not sure if \"Audiophile\" is really an appropriate term to describe it, but considering the size and weight these are the best portable speakers I think I've ever heard. I don't really see how a set of speakers this size could sound better without violating laws of physics. The Lithium ion battery might be a drawback for some (some people prefer AA or AAA batteries--rechargeable or otherwise--because they can be easily and cheaply replaced at the end of their lifespan), but it doesn't bother me. Especially since the battery is an integral part of the sound quality. It doubles as a bass radiator. Very cool.</td></tr><tr><td>I gave this a 4 star rating rather than a 5 star rating because the sugar spoon is very small, more like a salt spoon size. The handle of the spoon is long.  The sugar bowl fits 3/4 cup to 1 cup of sugar.  It's small but holds more sugar than one would think.  Very nicely made.  I like the indentation (hole) in bowl to hold the spoon.  I have other sugar spoons that are an actual teaspoon size, which fits nicely in this bowl.  Because we only use 2 tsps. of sugar per day, I only need to fill the bowl every two weeks.  Am very happy with this purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>I've been meaning to find something like this for a while. I didn't need anything too fancy, just wanted the groove cleaner and brush. The clip fits perfectly on my bag, and I'm never without it.</td></tr><tr><td>I got this for my son (who is 2+ yrs.) because I thought he was still to young for the Razor scooter (I was wrong). He doesn't like this scooter at all, he does 3 steps on it and he wants me to carry it. It's hard for him to keep pushing and pushing, unlike the Razor it's much easier. Very disappointing and waste of money.</td></tr><tr><td>The item in the picture and the item received are very different. While I realize it said the colors would vary the mustang that came was covered in 'racing' stickers. The whole car was covered. You cant even tell that its suppose to be a mustang. Its solid blue covered in large stickers from the hood, doors, roof, and trunk. I bought this for a friends son so for a child it turned out fine but I would not recommend buying a product that is nothing like the item shown or the description given.</td></tr><tr><td>I'm pleasantly surprised with this purchase! The case came in a really pretty pink box. Made me feel like I was giving myself a present! I get so many compliments about my case. Everyone loves it and its very beautifully designed!</td></tr><tr><td>I have been ordering and using Dr. Schultz's colon cleanse for about 3 years now.This product definetely works and I cannot do without.Like a lot of women, I experience constipation and I have tried many products to keep me regular.  Nothing works well without horrible side effects.  Dr. Schultz's Colon Cleanse works gently and effectively.  I use it everyday.</td></tr><tr><td>Reading the reviews, it seems the majority of complaints are in regards to the plastic extension piece.  I am not using that piece, however, and I absolutely love these stands.  They look great, the different colored base plates give you options, and they were the perfect height!  Assembly was a cinch, the wiring is hidden well, and the carpet spikes keep them from toppling over when my 2 year old acts like a 2 year old.Remember, you are only paying half or less than the other options, so for me that are an incredible value.</td></tr><tr><td>I love this blowdryer.  I love how I don't have to mess around with the cord anymore.  The cord does, however, get stuck sometimes and you have to unwind it and do it over and over again until the cord is properly inserted back into the blowdryer.  I also get this burnt smell from the dryer after using it for 10 minutes.  Still, I like this blowdryer more than the ones I've used in the past.</td></tr><tr><td>This is easily the best monitor I've encountered. I expected a white noise machine reminiscent of a WWI radio, but this had easy interface, nifty features, and a great range and talkback, what made this better was the noise leveling. The monitor apparently determined the background noise level and gradually tunes it out, so rather than a hissing box like the worlds angriest cat, the receiver just sits there until baby cries. The volume does leave something to be desired, so if you're a deep sleeper this may not be the best choice, but otherwise this is superb.</td></tr><tr><td>I actually think these are better than the ones I got when I first got my BEATS! When I first got my headphones I used them for like a few months and the wires was already starting to break. But these are awesome. Nice!</td></tr><tr><td>It works, but boy does it take some effort!!! It's not too bad with diesel fuel or #2, although a bit more effort is required than I'd like. Even using it on tranny fluid will wear you out after a while. Try it on anything thicker than that & your gonna be there for a while. I've had this for just about 6 months now & there's no change from when it was new. A small amount of bleed back through the check valve on the intake side has just started as well. Probably something stuck between the check ball & it's seat - I'll have to tear it down and investigate that. Also, the way they fold the lines for shipping results in permanent kinks, which further restrict flow & add to the effort. If there was a coil of wire inside the hoses - similar to the lower radiator hoses on older cars - this would be a big plus.  All in all, it does work ... just not fast .. or easy.</td></tr><tr><td>I had to replace one of my optic cables that was 3 feet long because I was moving around my home threater setup.  I believe I paid around $20~$30 for @ bestbuy for mere 3 feet.  Going back to major retailers, these suckers run $50 and up.  I didn't want to forcefully pay $50 to replace my working 3ft cable.Even with shipping it was around $5.  Obviously, no retail stores can beat that price for what it offers.  I was little surprised to see how skinny the cable was compared to my other ones.  It's literally feels like a straw you get with a hot cup of coffee.  I'm guessing the price cut comes from getting rid of protective cover of the cable.It sure feels unsafe. However, it WORKS just like other ones.  Unless you have ears like a dog and ultra-high end sound system, I don't think this will be a problem.  If you had the money to burn, you would be looking at Monster cables instead of cheapy ones like this.  I'm guessing as long as your children or pet are not around the cable, it should be fine.</td></tr><tr><td>I love this saw! But it's only as good as you are in shape.My wife and I went on our 1st camping trip, I took this little saw along. After camp was all setup (like a pro :) I started in sawing on about an 8\" log. A fellow seasoned camper sees me, comes rushing over with his full-handled axe to save the day and save some newbies from wasting energy. His mouth dropped open when he saw how fast I went through that log. Best of all, I looked like a stud in front of the wife, and cut three days worth of wood :)</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased these thinking they would be decent or whatever but I was REALLY surprised. They sound like pure #swag</td></tr><tr><td>she seems to really like these but they should tell you to buy a finger protector as the kids like to chow down on your finger!</td></tr><tr><td>Man....i have never felt so jipped about paying ten dollars for a ceedee than this one. This band...well maybe i would have nejoyed their songs...IF I WAS STILL IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. Their songs sound quite lame just like the mtv &quot;punk&quot; bands good charlotte and new found glory. I mean...i like greenday, i like sugarcult and i likED simple plan and blink....but wakefield is just not that good. They just follow the &quot;succesful 'punk' band formula&quot; and they are perfect for being role models for middle schoolers who wear atticus and wristbands cuz they think they are so cool for being punks -_-Anyhow, only get this album if yur a die hard fan and you want somthing generic. If you awnt something more mature or different...stay away from this album...Faaaaar away.</td></tr><tr><td>Have others like this but this unit is sturdy and reliable.  An excellent piece of equipment for the price.  Would definitely buy another one.</td></tr><tr><td>This color is awful, is like a red-orange, burnt-orange.... and shimmer, it does not say it is shimmer... maybe it works for an old lady...no no</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased these mats in light tan when I bought my car new, but never liked them; they showed the dirt too much, and eventually I could not get them clean, so I ordered the black ones; they are much more forgiving on dirt.  Both the black mats and tan mats have a light texture to them.  This texture makes the mats challenging to clean; you can't just wipe them and go; a bristle brush or scotch scrubber pad and a fair amount of elbow grease is required to get the dirt off.  The OEM mats that I bought from Honda back in 2004 for my '04 Accord were a smooth, thick rubber; the surface was smooth and easy to clean, but it was not slick; they are a nice floppy, heavy rubber; great mats!  Not sure why they changed the design. For the price, I decided to stick with these mats since they are OEM; did not like the look of the Weathertechs.</td></tr><tr><td>Gees love quality, especially when a product does what it suppose to do-open close, and no need to go to your local hardware and try to find a clerk who is less informed then you, it was by people like you who write reviews-hence the purchase and Walla it works, now the clerk at the store did not know a thing and stood blank when I had questions, and we wonder where our stores are going-America time to wake up, Amazon is WIDE AWAKE along with the other retailers here BIG THANKS! And GOD BLESS! P.S. Happy holidays, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year</td></tr><tr><td>I have 5 of these 16GB cards that I use with my Canon HF200 AVCHD camera. I especially like Amazon's \"frustration free packaging\" which makes it very easy to open the package. You wont need \"the jaws of life\" to cut open a plastic container used in retail. I get 1.5 hours at max quality settings with my camera and am very happy with that. I would not hesitate to purchase more of these in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>this machete is hands down the best , not a cheap machete like cold steel and other junk.  If you are looking for a sturdy tough machete this is the one!!</td></tr><tr><td>Great plugs and were much cheaper than the price at Auto Zone.  These were stock replacements for a 2005 3.5 Altima SE with 106,000 miles.  Horrible process to replace so I made sure I got the stock replacements so the car can go another 100,000 miles.  After installing the car ran much smoother like new again.</td></tr><tr><td>Star Trek was the SyFy that set the stage for what the future may look like. Short lived series that has been replayed ever since.</td></tr><tr><td>This appears to be the same as Plant Fusion Protein powder if you compare ingredients side by side.  A good smooth and easily mixable protein powder. I have a very temperamental stomach and this protein is one of the only plant based proteins that it doesn't have problems with.  This is my go to protein powder after a workout. I like to mix this with 1/2 cup almond milk, 1/2 cup carrot juice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbs almond butter and ice in the blender. It is a delicious dessert for me when I am craving sweets too.</td></tr><tr><td>When I was a kid  I always enjoyed these movies at time of christmas.....feels like time is back ....without black and white of course...</td></tr><tr><td>This is a really nice OtterBox.  I like the defender series as they provide the most protection to your phone.  My husband is very patriotic and really wanted a red/white/blue case.  This was perfect and the colors are nice and vivid.  Would recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>I actually read about this container on a blog where it was suggested for traveling. I like to bring my own food when traveling (unless I am lucky enough to go to SFO) so as to avoid gross airport food- I thought this would be a great solution to pack food then store easily. However, I packed it full for a trip and found it exploded in my bag (the top popped off as the container began to collapse into itself with the food in it). I tried it again for work thinking this was a fluke, but it happened again. I contacted customer service and they were willing to accept it as a return.</td></tr><tr><td>Even though this was an old version and a used/ refurbished phone, it's just like new to me! I don't order things online often and was worried it wouldn't meet my expectations but it did. It came in only a few days which was awesome! Love my new/ old phone!!</td></tr><tr><td>What I don't like is I am having issue with this thing staying linked to my Iphone.  I have to  re-pair almost daily!.It is a pain to charge as you have to make sure it is 100% lined up and tightly secured.It is a pain to set up!The band does pop loose and I have almost lost it a few times.The tracker is a bit off but I was not soley relying on it for tracking.I do like that I can see when I am getting a text message. My husband use to lose contact with me when I was at the barn with my horse.I do like that it is water resistant</td></tr><tr><td>I highly recommend this its cheap and works like a charm and shipped here a day before it was expected :D</td></tr><tr><td>Looks like this item is out of style and people sell off the leftovers.Came 2 weeks after ordering, as soon as it heated up the steam of vapor came from the back safety valve/air-pump intakeSilently evaporated all the water over our polished cabinets and shut down empty.Looks cute though, and theoretically should have been a great piece</td></tr><tr><td>Works fine but like others posted, baby can't figure it out 3 year old loves it though. Doesn't leak as fat as I can tell.</td></tr><tr><td>Fits our toilet, looks kinda like a mushroom in there, but it works for my husband, and raises the seat a little which makes it easier for him to get up. Bought this size as the last seat was broken by him. This one's weight rating well exceeds his weight, so no more problems there.</td></tr><tr><td>This thing is like magic.  Swirl it around your wall and BOOM...there are some nails hidden there that you never knew existed..Great old school way of finding the studs in your wall.  I used this to help hang a plasma tv on the wall.  It didn't let me down.  Super strong magnet will stick on the wall without holding it.  And if you happen to put it on your fridge....good luck man...put your back into it...you might eventually be able to peel it off!</td></tr><tr><td>It fits like a glove on my bersa thunder 380. It is however very hard to get on. But that is also a good thing, because it is snug and you wont have to worry about slipping. It is very comfortable and the finger groove is in the perfect spot. I am very happy with it. It does seem to reduce recoil, even if it is a little bit. Plus, it helps with the roughness of stock grips on guns that rub into your hands.</td></tr><tr><td>purchased the knife around 2006, its still working like new. The knife is still sharp.What else do you expect?  It's hard to see such an product now days.</td></tr><tr><td>living in a lonely, isolated societygovernment fearing an independent-thinking publicall information coming through big screen on the wallTV being used as a pacifierspouse at home in front of TV popping pills all day longnot  allowed to question whyHey, that sounds like today</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased the Cooks Standard multi-ply stainless set and I was not disappointed! I am a cook/baker by trade and I found this cookware to be of good quality; much better than I expected, and affordable. The Cooks Standard multi-ply was purchased to replace my Emeril All Clad that I've had for a few years. I'm passing the Emeril cookware to my son, who has just realized his passion for cooking. The Cooks Standard holds heat well, no hot spots, no sticking of foods, and over easy eggs released easily. (just remember to use heat no higher than medium, on any range.) The lids fit snugly, pans clean easily, and like all good quality stainless, doesn't need high heat to sear or cook evenly. My only complaint about this set is that it didn't include the wok or a 14 inch skillet.I highly recommend this set of cookware, as it is a good value and good quality.</td></tr><tr><td>Count on 2-5 being stuck or not working but other than that..loved them!! I did not have to glue anything like some reviews said. Easy to put together especially with a little help. The guests were charmed as these are tiny, not too tiny.. and cute.</td></tr><tr><td>THIS STORAGE SEAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED.  FUNCTIONAL AND DURABLE.  IT IS WATERPROOF AS WELL WHICH IS QUITE HELPFUL.  I LIKE IT SO MUCH I ORDERED THE SUNCAST TRASH BIN AND STORAGE BOX.</td></tr><tr><td>I like the ability of to control devices connected to the router thru my dlink.You can block any unwanted device using the mydlink centre.I recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>These things seem to be very hit and miss. The packaging looks like a legit HP cartridge but it sure doesn't perform like one.  I suppose you get what you pay for.At this point, I'm better off buying the full-price toner directly from HP, at least then I know it will work properly.</td></tr><tr><td>the leash is ok but light is not bright enough love the bag holder i had to tape another flash light on top  sometimes it feels like it is not stong enough for my 18lb dog though but its alright i guess</td></tr><tr><td>My review may be biased but I love love love the Golden Girls. So humorous without profanity and nudity. I know I've watched every single episode when I had cable on lifetime but can't get enough of the four great friends. I feel like I'm at home when I watch this show.</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered in mid- December and was given an estimated delivery date of mid- January.  but it arrived by Royal Mail in time to be gifted on the big day.  I like the nice clean lines, and my English SO is pleased with how his toast is dried and crisped.  (I may never understand English toast!)</td></tr><tr><td>Bought for casual to a little more competitive gaming. (League of Legends, Counter Strike) Works just like a charm. If my PC was better, I could be using the mouse to its full potential with more up to date games. However, this mouse does the job.</td></tr><tr><td>Cool Water is a very nice, subtle, cologne.  It is more of a conservative scent, but very attractive.  It is not over-powering like some; it is well ... cool. Maybe not the best choice if going to the club, but on a nice dinner date - perfect.  For the price this is an outstanding deal!</td></tr><tr><td>I like it very good I wish it came with plastic cover but it's a littlle pricy  work nice and quiet thanks Eyal</td></tr><tr><td>I started using these when my 11 yr old got braces, and I didn't want him chewing a hard vitamin. Plus, these aren't sugary like Flinstones, which I think are quite detrimental to teeth. Should've got them as soon as my kids could swallow pills! Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>Just like other reveiwers I like this way better than the stick.  I was given the stick at a course I went through and that was were I was introduced to rolling.  I have been impressed with the results of self massage, this is a far superior product, with out the hard beads of the stick you can roll away.  Easaly twice as good and the same price.</td></tr><tr><td>We looked everywhere for this pin but it was sold out in our town.  My daughter wears it everywhere she goes and l worried that she would lose it since she tends to forget about things like pins on her clothing but not this one.  She is super protective of it.  She is obviously a big fan of the Hunger Games.</td></tr><tr><td>This is the best value for the money game I have ever bought. Somehow we never get tired of it and it's fun always. It will keep children busy for about an hour or more and its a real challenge to spot the matches. I would buy this for anyone, and I think adults might like it too. Sometimes you play a game with kids and its terrible for the adults. Not with this one.</td></tr><tr><td>It's really convenient to be able to carry 3 cards without a wallet, but it doesn't feel like the safest case in the world.</td></tr><tr><td>Just like all the Melissa and Doug toys my kids have, this one is outstanding and a new favorite.  Not that they don't still play with the old food sets they have received in the past.  My kids are 2 and 4.  Both LOVE playing with these sets.  We have several, they like to play restaurant.  We have so many sets there is a wide variety of things to 'order' so it never gets boring.  This was a nice addition to our collection.  I also purchased other Melissa and Dougs toys this Christmas including the Sandwich Making Game and the Blocks.  Both seem to be a big hit already.  I will actually be sad when my kids are to old to play with this stuff but honestly I think it will be a while before that happens.  Great line of toys!  Highly recommend.  Also every year sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas they usually have a sale and items are marked down to $10 and available for free super saver shipping.  I usually buy several sets to give as birthday gifts throughout the year.  They are always a big hit!!!</td></tr><tr><td>The color and stitching on these King Shams is like what you see in the picture. The poplin is strong and easily covers a true king-size bed pillow. You can machine wash and dry them easily and if you take them out of the dryer when it stops, you will not need to iron them. They have held their shape and color through several washings. In fact, I liked them so well that I purchased another color, too.</td></tr><tr><td>If you know what pantry moths are, you probably also keep pet birds.  That means that you cannot get rid of the moths by fumigating because that will harm the birds.  Anyway, a single fumigation only eliminates the adult moths, so you have to do it repeatedly to kill the emerging moths - what a hassle. And the next time you open new seed the cycle starts over. My experience is that once you have moths you have moths indefinitely until you no longer have birds.  Replace these every month and savor the satisfaction of seeing the little criminals stuck to the glue, beating themselves to death. In a cruel irony only the males are trapped (like humans).  The females are insanely jealous because the traps work so well so they fly around warning the males that the traps are like a bait car.  Do the males listen?  Not so you would notice (also like humans).  Consistent use of these traps won't eliminate moths but they will be rarely seen because the males spend way too much time romancing the traps to get the girl moths in trouble.  Recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>Three stars because I haven't tasted it yet; I was just looking at other mixes to order so when I bottle this weekend I can cook another batch.  Here's the problem:  the mixes have doubled in price.  I got the Bruxelles for $15.00 and w/ Amazon Prime; now all the mixes with the exception of the Jalapeno are $30.  I will never be able to justify spending $30 to do all of that work to produce 9 x 12oz bottles of beer, plus all of the other things like sanitizer and bottle caps.What happened?I realize prices are going up in general, but I'm not sure how this beer mix went from $15 to $30 in the span of a month.  Maybe someone can illuminate the issue for me, but I can tell you I won't be buying it from Amazon anymore.I'll do an update after I sample it, I'm looking forward to it.  I will be popping a brown ale this weekend from Brooklyn Brew Shop.</td></tr><tr><td>this is a neat little gun. I enjoy it and my husband enjoys it even more! i havent even got to shoot it yet but it looks like a lot of fun. the orange part fell off almost as soon as i opened it and the shells only hold one plastic BB. the gun is mostly plastic</td></tr><tr><td>This thing is easy to use and maneuverable, once you put it together that is. Other than that it has low suction, low volume canister that needs to be emptied very often, cheap plastic parts, very small inlet for picking up dirt so won't pick up any sizable waste, and the suction hose is short and hard to use. All the good reviews must like the high tech look and maneuverability and don't know what a real vacuum can do. I hate this vacuum, oh and it gets clogged all the time. Just bought a Kenmore Intuition (12 amp direct drive motor, HEPA filter, large bag) on sale and half the price of the Dyson at $229 plus $34 for and 2 year extended Warranty. Will let you know! Also like our Hoover Wind Tunnel very much.</td></tr><tr><td>I've been buying and using this soap for years. I use it for a body wash and a face wash. I don't know about all the anti aging claims on the back because I have wrinkles, but I don't think a soap can cure or be blamed for wrinkles! It is a great soap. It cleans well with no residue, smells good (it may take some getting used to because it isn't fruity scented like other body washes), and moisturizes without leaving me greasy. This stuff won't lather up like soaps with SLS, but a little bit on a washcloth is all it takes to get clean from it. Highly recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>I like it but by design it only gets to 102 or the dog's normal body temp they tell me. Its better than nothing but may not be enough for cold weather. Does have some nice features such as the wire around the power cord, the cover and the thermostat that reacts to the dogs presence.</td></tr><tr><td>I usually go for citrusy-light fragrances. I bought this as part of a mini-perfume set. I thought the smell was too strong at first, but the other day I tried it and now I love it. I feel warm and cozy when I wear it, and I don't get a headache. It's a very fall/winter scent. Oftentimes I associate scents with a place and time; I wanted to avoid wearing this to work because I didn't want to have that association, but for some reason with this scent I don't. It's just so good! It lasts a long time, and it smells like a million bucks.</td></tr><tr><td>I've used this sander a lot over the past three years and like it even better than my Festool (heresy, I know).  Sandpaper goes on and off easily and the sander is very controllable and well-balanced.  Hooked up to a shop vac the dust collection is great.  BUT the sander sometimes restarts after having been turned off.  I place it on the floor if I stop sanding so it can't ruin a piece or the benchtop.  I can live with that but it's why I can't give this tool a five-star review.</td></tr><tr><td>of course, its a single serve blender with a to-go, detachable travel mug; That in itself is pretty f-ing fantastic. IN ADDITION, its size is PERFECT for lazy smoothie-and-milkshake drinkers because it is SO. EASY. TO. WASH. Did I mention it's really easy to wash?PROS:- small size- easy to wash- detachable, convenient travel mugCONS:- blade is not that powerful for all your high smoothie connoisseurs out there- must add some kind of liquid to get the blade a-smoothie-ing if you're just using pure (frozen) fruit or hard solid objects (even soft ice cream)- Can smell a weird plastic smell when I get the cup out of the cupboard to make myself a smoothie after about 12 uses, but I just rinse the little sucker- Can actually smell the exhaustion of the spinning blades as I hold down that blend/torture button. But just gently remove your finger after a while of straight blending, then resume torture.All in all, I would recommend this bad baby. Seriously. Buy it. It's really convenient. And did I mention it cleans well?</td></tr><tr><td>Can't use it because it smells like burning glue or rubber. I wish I could return it, but I have already thrown away the packaging.</td></tr><tr><td>If I could give this 0 stars I would!  This was supposed to be a reward for my daughter for doing great at school and I received this piece of junk in the mail.  It looks exactly like the Rainbow Loom box, but it's not.  My daughter had her friends over with their Rainbow Looms and hers is a piece of junk and it's embarrassing.  Terrible quality and you can't move the loom around like the original.  Don't buy unless it's from an authorized retailer unless you want a hunk of junk.  The knock off from the dollar store is better than this POS.</td></tr><tr><td>We ordered the platypus earlier this week along with some other Kyjen dog toys.  I had high hopes because my dogs love things they can pull apart and disassemble.  If we don't give them toys that are made for this, they'll do it anyway :-)Unfortunately, the hole on the underside of the platypus where you are to insert and then the dog removes the eggs is way too small.  Even using both of my hands and with the advantage of thumbs, I have a hard time doing it.  It's just too tight.  My dogs didn't stand a chance.I gave it 3 stars, however, because my dogs like anything that squeaks and it's still a cute toy they can play with.  It just doesn't function quite the way it was intended.For a similar concept and also from Kyjen, I would recommend either theKyjen Plush Puppies Ginormous Hide-A-Squirrelor theKyjen I-Qube Puzzle Plush Interactive Dog Toy, Large.  We also have both of these and they work great!  Our dogs love playing with them and the concentration it takes to pull out the toy inserts provides good mental stimulation.</td></tr><tr><td>It a very nice compact cloth I like that it hooks to your camera or bag or wherever.To me it is a little small but on the other side that is what makes it so compact.. I like it to have as a back up that you never forget since it is attached. I am happy I purchased it.</td></tr><tr><td>After looking at quite a few different vibrators I finally took a chance and bought this one and I say I couldn't be happier with how it works! It came in a discreet Amazon box and it was wrapped in some type of black saran wrap like material.</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent season just like the first one, I hope they renew this show for a couple of more seasons with a new cast every time like I read that they might be doing.More Sleeper Cell for the people!</td></tr><tr><td>This is  an incredibly detailed toy. It appears to be very sturdy. The detail is easily in the same league as the drawings in dragonology. It is about 8.5\" high and about 12\" across. I bought it as a toy for my grandson, but any collector of dragons would, I think, like it very much. I  don't even like dragons, but I know beauty and craftmanship when I see it. A great item.</td></tr><tr><td>Installed on a Ruger LC9 for the wife. It makes the gun more aesthetically pleasing without making the gun look like a toy. (It does not look like a toy like guns with pink frames and rainbow slides do, it looks like a gun with a pink grip on it and it will be taken seriously).Aside from aesthetics, it really does improve performance. I have Hogue products on everything from my Shotgun, AR, Pistols...everything. These slip on grips are no exception to excellence. They give the shooter a much better grip and solid grip of the weapon without adding too much bulk for easy concealment. Her confidence with the gun is higher, her grip is better, her hand is steadier, and her groupings are now much better because of those factors.Get this product for your wife. Get black ones for yourself.</td></tr><tr><td>These have been working well for me as I hike the Appalachian Trail. I like the visibility of the line on the stakes under a headlamp at night.</td></tr><tr><td>Just received the UA football chin strap. It looks good and like it is made of good quality. It was cheaper from here than any other place that I've checked. My son says it fits the chin strap very well on his helmet. If it holds up as well as it looks you can't go wrong. I would recommend this for any football player.</td></tr><tr><td>Like the tape. Just when I though I was gonna have to live with my knee pain a friend wrapped up my knee with what he had left. I'm now hooked</td></tr><tr><td>The guns range and almost accuracy is nice, but there will be no surprise ambushes with this gun. When you turn it on it sounds like the dyng fan from an old PC or something.</td></tr><tr><td>i really like this stuff, nice that it smells decent and lasts aslong as you want it to and can be as dark as you want depending on the amount you apply.</td></tr><tr><td>Like the cushy design.  They sound good and stay in my ears.  The price was reasonable and they arrived quickly</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this for my boyfriend, I'm not giving it to him till Christmas, but of course when it came in the mail I had to open it and smell it! It smelt soooo goood! This is a deffinite pick. I sprayed some on my arm, it stayed ALL day. I just wanted to get a smell sniff, it was there the entire day until I showered the next morning! Good thing I didn't hang out with him that day he'd be like whaattt haha. But this is a deffinite pick for any guy that wants to smell yummyyy.</td></tr><tr><td>nothing spectacular, just a battery that works.....  yaaaaaaay.  i like to get the batteries here, why pay $20+ when the generics are the same performance wise?</td></tr><tr><td>This is an excellent purchase.  It's very warm, almost so much that I was sweating. It will save you on your heating/gas bill.  It is cozy and soft, and not only looks like a cloud but feels like one too. It is translucent. Buy this.</td></tr><tr><td>I was expecting the packages to have the lift and seal feature on the top so I didn't have to find a container to put them in. I wish I would have read more carefully before buying them. Also, they are thinner than expected. I like Dollar General's brand much better.</td></tr><tr><td>ProsThis cup does not leak at allWeighted straw is awesomeConsThe one I ordered was only able to hold like 6-8 oz so I am constantly refillingYou cant take it apart to clean the straw so you got to make sure to run water through it very well.Overall I like it, but I also got the tommy tippee cups and those are awesome and dont leak they are kind of a pain to clean but i can clean the whole thing unlike this cup.</td></tr><tr><td>Cooks up almost exactly like wheat pasta. With sauce it's virtually indistinguishable from regular penne pasta. Without sauce, a very mild taste difference. Springy texture. To reheat, do not use microwave. Keep sauce separate from pasta. After I cooked pasta, I put on a little olive oil. To reheat the next day, toss unsauced pasta into boiling water to reheat briefly, drain and add sauce. Perfect.</td></tr><tr><td>Vague and poor information to understand how to connect the TV to other devices like PC etc. the TV is good but if you are going to buy one be sure you have ALL that is required to make it function properly, I have made at least 10 trips to electronic stores and the result is still not great &#34;cause Im not an expert in connecting TV to other sources. Sound is the mayor problem</td></tr><tr><td>So glad I found this monkey on Amazon at such a great price.  When my youngest was born almost 2 years ago we were given a monkey just like this that was bought at a local store.  Well who knew that would be the item she has clung too for 2 years.  The original minkey has been starting to appear a little worn around the ages and I was so afraid that something would happen to it so we founf it here and orderd it.  It was here in like 3 days in perfect condition and a great price I could not ask for better.  I have always received excellent sevice from Amazon.</td></tr><tr><td>I LIKE THIS WATCH VERY MUCH IT'S BEAUTIFULL, BUT THE BROWN STRAP CAME WITH A LITTLE DAMAGE. WHAT CAN I DO TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM ? PLEASE LET ME KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLETHANKYOU  CARLOS</td></tr><tr><td>I got these from Get and Go for $9.60 for a set of 4 with free delivery.  They serve their purpose and are exactly like RSVP brand and others out there for a few dollars less.  The only thing I wish is these straws be a little wider (they're smaller than standard drinking straws.)  It's good to go green :)!</td></tr><tr><td>Taste like a cough syrup.  Not very desirable, although I do like the Wonder Drink brand. Because the label is also red, it is easy to get confused with Traditional flavor, which is outstanding.</td></tr><tr><td>Scents are very subjective, especially ones with vague names like \"fresh waters.\" It's hard to put into words this product's scent-- I mildly liked it, my wife disliked it. Even being set at the lowest output level you could smell it over most of our first floor. Even at lowest level the product only lasted a few weeks. Would not purchase it again.</td></tr><tr><td>I've put 5 stars because it has filled my expectations.Constructed of a very good material.Very versatile.Protects the lens well.It is an accessory that every lens should have. I like that it is retractable and can save without problems.</td></tr><tr><td>My biggest concern was that my dog wouldn't like them.  She gobbles them up.  She's small so she only gets one a day, but she'd be happier if she could have more.</td></tr><tr><td>love it for indoor and outdoor tanning. non greasy and smells really good, like your on the beach. I recommend</td></tr><tr><td>I like this bib as it has very soft fabric and as the same time absorbs milk spit. And, both sides can be used.</td></tr><tr><td>I just love my Fiesta Ware.  It is pretty and functional, as well as durable.  Only thing....it doesn't like granite countertops.</td></tr><tr><td>This motherboard simply did not work. Just beyond the BIOS during hardware probing it locked up and never got to a GUI. The freeze always came at the point it was probing USB hardware. I'm not sure what the problem was, but I replaced it with a Biostar MB that this ASRock was supposed to replace and I had no problems. I simply urge caution when purchasing motherboards/electronics from ASRock. Like many Chinese products, when they work - they work well, but the number of defective items not captured by quality control is too high. Not a lot of quality built in. It had a good price, and much potential (considering the rear panel ports), but when it doesn't work potential doesn't mean very much.</td></tr><tr><td>This movie will make you laugh. It is not even remotely scary and the \"gore\" is just laughable.  It does have its gratuitous sex scenes with hilarious \"sexy\" music.  But the hardly attractive women seem like they wish they were doing their nails instead of getting nailed.  I had to turn this movie off after 45 minutes.  This is one of the worst attempts at cheesy horror ever made...yet I rented part 2 for some reason!  Ha...we shall see if they can redeem themselves.</td></tr><tr><td>We really have enjoyed our desks from this company ,, They look really good in our room the corner unit is very spacious for big chairs we really like our desks we ordered from Bush Furniture they were fast and effiecent on shipping and delivering it !! not sure on the assembling part my husband did that part but he did a great job since the company sent everything he needed to put it together nothing was missing !! Thanks =))</td></tr><tr><td>I've had this pedal for 14 hours and have lost 8 of them just trying to wrap my brain around it.  I've run a microphone, guitar and baritone guitar (picked, tapped, and *swoon* ebowed), and an electric viola through it and all of them react differently to it.there are 250 wave tables and four pretty much dual purpose knobs which dramatically alter the sounds of each wave table you select.  some wave tables turn the higher kHz range into chaotic static.  some wave tables don't make any sound at all with a particular instrument, then you plug another one through it and it's insanity.It's diminutive in size and weighs next to nothing, but is built like a tank and puts out noise that could wake the dead.I would agree that this pedal is a tone junkie's worst nightmare, but if you are the type who enjoys experiments in sound i can't recommend it enough.I like it so much I'm actually considering buying a few backups of this pedal in case the company discontinues the line.</td></tr><tr><td>It sounded like a good idea.  The only problems with it are that the connect to the iPhone/iPod/iPad is kind of tight and unsteady.  The AV cables do not stay easy.  For a quick fix, it's ok.  For long time use, invest the money in something else.</td></tr><tr><td>I like the quality of the hose, and as many other reviewers noted its super heavy duty and just great quality. The only thing is that while being such heavy duty, the hose is not very flexible at the coupling area. This is good, to prevent leaks, but I wish it came with an elbow connection option so that I could push my washer back just a bit more.</td></tr><tr><td>Like most Planet Bike products, this is very functional and a good value.  I've installed many racks in my time, so the fact that the hardware was pre-installed didn't matter to me.  But if this is your first time installing a rack, you will find such a feature useful. Buy with confidence.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this after a friend raved about it. It does what it should-i.e. steams the floor and gets up spots. The problem is that you have to get up everything off of the floor or you will be shoving dust balls in globs around and have to go picking them up. It also cannt get around things like toilets which I guess nothing but a mop can. Not sure if it is really worth the investment to have to use other cleaning items anyway.</td></tr><tr><td>What you see is what you get. The only surprise is that the nylon watch strap is less thick than I thought. It's like a backback's nylon straps. I don't really notice it's on my wrist now. I'm a big guy and the size is right. Good looking watch, and if I broke or lost it, the low cost makes it no big deal at all.</td></tr><tr><td>My baby likes the gym! Granted I have bought extra links that hang down and have other toys that I attached to it as well but overall my daughter likes it.  I put the mirror up in the center of the beams of the gym and she will talk talk talk to it. Like what another reviewer said \"No gym is going to be absolutely perfect\" but this gets the job done and for the amount of time my baby has used it and had fun with it, it is worth the money.  I like it overall and could point out the little things that are not as great but really it doesn't matter because my daughter really likes playing on it regardless if the music is playing or not.</td></tr><tr><td>they don't don't look like much but they are tough little restraints so far. They are very comfortable and very durable so far. Have used them a few times now and no problems that i can see. Very satisfied. If they last 6 months i'd be happy to buy another pair. For the money and what they do, it's worth it.</td></tr><tr><td>Due to the nature of our business we don't have time for TV in the spring and summer. Therefore we don't subscribe to cable TV and miss a lot of the shows we like. The Netgear Neo fills the void and allows us to view many of the programs we missed. Works well with Amazon / Amazon Prime. Some of the reviews we looked at prior to purchasing had complainants about the remote. It is packed with buttons and the mouse pad takes a little time to master however, we have found it to work just fine with a little practice.</td></tr><tr><td>The battery doesnt work whatsoever. I charged it right and no energy at all. Ive used batteries like this before so i know how to charge them but this one just wont work. Also i cant return it.</td></tr><tr><td>Finally a remote that was able to learn my Dish PVR receiver and a host of other components. I also like the ability of the remote to be programmed to a standard code and then let you additionally add other key functions trhough the learn capability. Definitely worth the money!</td></tr><tr><td>What a tasty treat!  Easy to heat up in the microwave and perfect portion control in the individual packages.  I tried it yesterday with some strawberries, and it was delicious.  You can use it to dip as you eat, like in a fondue, or you can dip the items and put them in the fridge for 15 minutes if you want the chocolate to harden.  I love this, and love that it is dark chocolate, which is not easy to find in the stores.  I am sure I will be ordering this product again!</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":51},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Can we speculate how a group got very few reviews?"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql SELECT review FROM clustered WHERE prediction = 5"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .table-result-container {\n    max-height: 300px;\n    overflow: auto;\n  }\n  table, th, td {\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n  }\n  th, td {\n    padding: 5px;\n  }\n  th {\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n</style><div class='table-result-container'><table class='table-result'><thead style='background-color: white'><tr><th>review</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>I have a LCD Cover Screen Protector on both my camera bodies.  The screen cover does make it a little harder to view my pictures in the direct sun.  A second problem is that dust gets between the LCD screen and the inside of the cover.  The dust requires that I remove the cover to clean it.  The answer would be for the manufacture to add a gasket to the inside of their screen protector to seal it.</td></tr><tr><td>I think liner is the wrong name for this product. It's more like a very thin pad. It's thicker than any other liner I've used. And it's big. Bigger than other liners too, even other \"long\" liners.It also has the signature Always \"super soft cover\" - it's kind of like a layer of mesh stuff over the pad. I hate that. The cover gives me a rash. So itchy.Most pads I've tried do have some kind of cover. But most liners don't, or they have a different kind. (Kotex for example.) Now, I know Always pads have a cover that makes me itch. I just thought the liners might be different. They are not. So if you're like me and you don't like the Always cover, you won't like these liners either.</td></tr><tr><td>There are so many dog foods to choose from it's hard to know which are the best, and which dog foods you can afford.  Yes, many would say \"don't own a dog if you can't feed him the best\" but not everyone can buy premium dog food.  That said, I feel as though this food is higher quality than many out on the market.  I like this, and I like that is higher priced but still affordable for a 70 pound dog (which I own).  I am not as picky as many dog owners, but I want something our dog will eat, something that does not give her stomach problems, a food that does not give make allergies a problem, and lastly something nutritious.  This seems to fit the bill.  She loved the food, in fact was thrilled to get to eat at her meals.  Second, she did not appear to have any problems with the food making her have stomach issues.  We mixed this slow with her other food and watched during the feedings to make sure she didn't seem bound up or have loose stools.  This was great!  Third, our dog has problems with allergies-this didn't seem to cause any \"worse\" problems.  In fact I would say that her allergies were \"better\" on this food.  Lastly, I am no expert but this does appear to be a more nutritious food than many on the market.  The ingredients are chicken, brown rice, vegetables, flaxseed, apples and cranberries.  NO artificial colors, flavors or preservative.  The company also offers a money back guarantee!</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this stroller several years ago when my condo board threatened to make us carry our dogs while in the building because of \"accidents\" in the elevators. Well, my dog weighs 28lbs when she is on her diet but can get up to 30 lbs ( I know bad mommy too many treats!) and I am not about to carry her. Anyway, I recently started using the stroller everyday because my dog is 13 yrs old, arthritic and has a weak bladder. The board didn't follow thru with their threat to make us carry our dogs but they did implement a rule that we will be fined if our dog has an accident. So to avoid being fined, I use the Guardian Gear Sprinter EXT stroller three times a day sometimes four times a day for potty breaks. It works great! I absolutely love this stroller. It rolls over grass, cement walkways, and gravel. I live near the beach but have not tried it in sand. I love that it has springs which make it flexible. I like the zippered cover and the fact that this stroller is 21\" long so that my large Bichon can fit in the stroller. I researched a lot of strollers years ago and found this was the only one that could accommodate a 30 lb dog and is also a jogger.The front wheel locking mechanism works great and is really helpful when I do my slow, very slow jog with my dog in the stroller. The basket underneath has a tendency to slide off, but I probably should just duck tape it on since I never remove it. It is large enough to carry a few groceries or other items if you are a shopper. I now can take my dog to the mall since when the cover is zipped up, most people think I have a baby because some of the baby strollers are made the same. Also, mall security doesn't mind dogs in the mall if they are in a stroller. It also folds very easily, you just push down on the red sliding buttons, push the stroller down and it is all folded up. It's not the most compact probably 6- 10 inches tall when all folded, but it fits fine in my SUV.My only complaint is that the pin that holds on the front wheel doesn't fit anymore and the wheel keeps coming off. The wheel is supposed to be slid on past a small groove on a bar and because of the flexibility of the stroller (a good feature) the wheel tends to move and the only thing holding it from going past the groove on the bar is a small metal pin, which kind of grips around the groove. It's difficult to explain but I think a pin that goes through a hole in the bar would have been a better construction.Other than that, I love, love, love this stroller. My husband concocted a fix for the wheel so I am still using my stroller and my \"baby\" loves it too.</td></tr><tr><td>I really liked the idea of my case and keyboard cover matching... So I found this and I was in heaven. It matched the case I fell in love with and I thought this was literally going to be perfect. Boy was I wrong.I have two major issues with this.1- this makes it harder to press your keys down. I liked how easy it is to press my mac's keys down and this just ruins it. Hate it. Another thing is that this cover takes away all of the backlighting that your keyboard has. On top of that, this cover would stick to my finger and pull the entire thing up. I kept replacing it more than it stayed on my keyboard. Needless to say, it just ended up coming off for good.2- the color doesn't match the case AT ALL. They are completely awful. It's not even close to the same color. If you were intending to match your case with your keyboard cover, don't go with this one. You think that buying from the same company would make it better..... it didn't. The case is a bright teal while this is more of a baby blue.I wouldn't recommend this to someone matching the case to the keyboard cover, but if you wanted to just cover up your keys, I guess this would do an okay job of it.</td></tr><tr><td>If you just got you iPad mini and you're looking around for a good case. Go with the Bear Motion.Great features at a glance:- Magnetic Sleep/Wake function cover- Access to buttons/ports- Foldable front cover for stand/grip- Felt/Suede-like inner lining that 'protects' your screen- Slim profile- Rubber frame to hold your iPad miniThe magnetic Sleep/Wake function cover allows you to put your iPad mini to sleep when you close the cover and wake it up when you open it up. Works great just like Apple's Smart Cover. The cover holds shut even when you over turn your iPad mini, the magnet holds the cover in place. The cover also folds away to form a mini stand for you to hold up the iPad mini, or as a grip when you're holding it.There's a rubber texture like frame that you fit your iPad mini onto to hold it securely in place. Your iPad mini would not fall off. Unlike other covers, this frame that holds your iPad mini has a soft texture like to it, which would not scratch your iPad mini's body when you fit it on. Also, it is rather easy to place your iPad mini in. This frame does not wrap around the top of the screen, meaning if you have a glass screen protector, this frame would still be able to hold the cover. The frame does not cover your ports and allow you full access to them, especially for the earphone port and the Lightning dock.Check out my pictures for a better illustration.This case looks and feel great. You would love to carry your iPad mini around with this cover on. The slim profile makes it easy to transport around.This case is nothing short of excellent. Highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>The fit and quality of the rail system is great. The vinyl is heavy duty, and the cover rolls up small enough to make access to the tool box easy. This cover is used on a work truck, and is subject to a lot of use. I have had no problems with the cover while driving on the highway with the cover rolled up or sealed shut. The cover fits tight, rolls easily, and has stood up to Florida downpours well.I installed this on a '96 F-250 with standard tool box and diamond plate bed rails. No trimming of the cover rails was required, all the parts necessary were there, and the installation was straight forward. Two people makes this job go much faster than doing it single handed. You will need a tube of silicone or other sealant to get a water tight fit along the toolbox face seal, as the boxes are not straight, mine was warped a little more than the provided seal could accommodate. Sealing will also be necessary at the forward cover rail to side cover rail joint. If you have a diamond plate bed rail, you will want to beef up the provided foam seal with a little silicone there as well. Don't forget to seal around and under your tool box. The extra caulking is easy if you plan ahead, and results in a completely dry box!</td></tr><tr><td>While the print is exactlt as shown,  the description is not true.  It plainly states 'Duvet Cover,  Panel Comforter. ' but there was no stuffing of any kind.  It is honestly 2 beautiful sheets sewn together.  I Googled Duvet Cover because I thought maybe I was the idiot,  and it plainly described a Single Duvet Cover as ' a simple quilt,  it consists of a soft bag filled with down, feathers, wool,  silk or synthetic alternitive.  Let me assure you,  this is just simply a reversible sheet.  I will rip the seam and sew in a quilt type soft cotton, so it will actually be more like a Duvet, or lite Comforter.  I am satisfied with the picture of the boys on the fabric ( And that is the ONLY reason I am not returning this double sheet)  it looks just as it is shown.  Also,  the fabric is very stiff, not at all soft or inviting,  I'm hoping a wash in cold (as to not fade out the color)  and alot of fabric softener before I actually start with tearing it apart to insert the stuffing,  will make it the Single Duvet Cover I thought I was purchasing for my daughter!!</td></tr><tr><td>PROS:(1) I like the expansion possibilies of this transfer switch (10 -16 breakers).(2) My electrician took about 3 hours to set this up.(3) The inlet plug is facing down which would be better when it rains. Should be dry this way.CONS:(1) No cover for transfer switch that could cover the EXPOSED breakers. If it is installed in a place where people walk frequentl one can easily touch a breaker and flip it without noticing. Looking for a cover currently. Seems one exists for $40 on Ebay. Search for \"101569 Gentran Dust Cover\". For the price of this unit, the dust cover could have been included...(2) No cover for the inlet plug outside. Although it will block water, insects might like to make a nest there as it is a dark, dry place so a cover would have been good.(3) Very confusing switchover to generator - breaker based - not switch based. (I put my own stickers to show what to do). This means that if you want to switch on the generator the breaker has to be flipped to the center (ON position) and NOT to where it says GEN MAIN. You have to think of it like \"Turning ON GEN MAIN\" when flipping to generator. It is something to get used to.(4) Also the sticker says \"GEN MAIN\" and \"UTIL MAIN\" when trying to switch. One phrase here: \"A picture tells a thousand words!\". I just glued a picture of the \"Telephone Wires\" where it says \"UTIL MAIN\" and put a picture of a generator where it says \"GEN MAIN\". Why couldn't Generac do that? Much easier to figure out in an emergency!</td></tr><tr><td>Bought this to cover a large Big Green Egg in a rolling nest with two Egg Mate shelves and am very satisfied with it.  The quality is good, the fit is better than the Big Green Egg brand cover it replaced, and it's cheaper than the brand-name cover.  The fabric doesn't clean up as easily as the old vinyl cover if you live where birds, pollen, etc. are a problem.</td></tr><tr><td>What a surprise. I thought I was ordering a hot water bottle COVER. I didn't realize the bottle was included. (I thought $9.99 was a little high for a cover). I wanted to use it with my Fashy hot water bottle. But since it was already in the cover and it was so pretty (and PINK), I decided to give it a go. I've read comments about the bottle being hard and inflexible but mine was not. It felt like any other standard, pliable hot water bottle. My Fashy is actually a little stiffer than this one. I folded it in half to remove it from the cover and filled it but then it wouldn't fit back into the cover so I poured out half and refilled it once it was covered. Thoughtless design - it's easy to get the cover wet that way. The bottle itself had a strong rubber smell but that's what new rubber smells like. I am allergic to latex but I figured it would be ok since it was covered. About 5 min after filling it, I was just sitting with it on my legs - I was on the phone and hadn't used it yet, I got a bad reaction to the latex requiring an immediate Claritin. I got a really awful metallic taste in my mouth and I could feel my tongue starting to swell. Soooooo...I poured the water out and threw in the tub where it remains. If you have a latex allergy, you may want to try the Fashy which feels like rubber but is a plastic product. It's still a decent bottle though - especially for the price. My daughters will get good use from it.</td></tr><tr><td>I noticed some reviews on this and the 3 gallon where some people didn't get A COVER! That is just a Boo Boo and you should have received a cover with the kit.It's a great little Tank, perfect for the Kitchen (great night light) and it HAS A COVER!I really wonder how long the water will stay clean?  I know not to buy a Goldfish because they are really nasty poopers and the chunky big snails leave icky poop behind as they eat. I am going to buy a beta after this tank \"cures,\" but I'd like to get another couple of fish to keep him company.Any good \"fish authorities\" out there with any suggestions? I had a pet shop and I had a massive fish department. I used to know who did what back in the early 80's.  I seem to have put all that out of my mind and now I don't remember ALL the fin nippers. I could really use some help here... lol.I know I can't get a sucker fish (algae eater)because they will become carnivorous if there is no algae to feed on and if you keep your tank TOO CLEAN.  I am living proof of that tidbit of Info.I'd appreciate any help here.  And also if anyone else has this 5 gallon tank - is the filtration system adequate and does the water stay clean?Thanks for any help I can get. ;>)</td></tr><tr><td>Did anyone get the Star Wars reference?Ok I hope that made you smile because this grill will provide you a lot of grief.With this Grill Cover you need to be very, very careful with it. So maybe you should leave it in the box it came in.The items arrived nice and quick and well packaged (Thank you Amazon) as always.We took the Grill cover out of the bag and place it on the Grill carefully and secured it with the pull cord which I really loved that feature.But in less than a month it developed tears along the seams and tears and rips just about everywhere else. So at that point we decided to order another grill cover which we paid $25 and Love it.But why did I leave it on that night? Well we were going to have a pretty decent rain shower with some good winds and I wanted to see ho the cover handled it.It did not. Not even close.The next day I exchanged for the newer grill cover and again bad weather with wind and rain. It handled it beautifully.So here are the pros and ConsPro's:Looks nice in the bag.I love the draw string on the bottomPriceCons:Very cheap material.It tears easily. The item did not make it a month.Yes the reviews are just about even with good and bad. But if you look at the bad reviews it the same problem over and over again.But even then I said hey it only needs to last one season and then I will get a good one when I can afford it.Well lesson learned :-(If you really want this cover then get it.Just like the Lottery. Hey, you never know~</td></tr><tr><td>Patti Smith-Horses *****Horses is a lot of things. It is one of the first and best punk albums of all time, it is Smiths finest record, one of the best albums of all time, one of the most important albums of all time, it's legendary, brilliant, poetic, socially conscious, angry, gentle...perfect.From the feminist album cover featuring Patti in her Keith Richards outfit, the one she wore all the damn time back in the day, to the last notes of the mournful 'Elegie' Horses is one of the most eclectic and genius pieces of music ever. The cover of Them's 'Gloria' with the infamous opening line \"Jesus died for somebody's sins/But not mine\" is maybe better than the original if you can believe it. The ska of 'Redondo Beach' (which by the way she was the only Yankee to attempt ska and reggae other then the Brits) is refreshing. 'Birdland' is haunting while 'Free Money' is hopeful. 'Kimberly' and 'Break It Up' are equally melloncholly. 'Land' is maybe the greatest song in the history of punk, featuring a cover of 'Land Of A Thousand Dances' making it easily the most original song of all time to feature a cover. 'Elegie' is a suicide song the closes the album scarily. On some versions of the newly remastered album there is a bonus cover of The Who's 'My Generation' which is killer to say the least.Whether it is the poetic beauty of the lyrics or the raw power of the music, Horses is an album worthy of every music collection, and of a listen from everyone. It is powerful and moving, more so than maybe any other album I have ever heard. Highly, highly, highly, recommended!</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":53},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":54}],"metadata":{"name":"05-NLP-CC","notebookId":3829983292049505},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
